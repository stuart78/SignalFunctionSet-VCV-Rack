# OP ENV Manual

## Overview

OP ENV is a standalone **DX7 operator envelope generator**. It loads a voice from a DX7 `.syx` bank (exactly like [Operator](operator-manual.md)), takes that voice's carrier envelope, and turns it into a gate-driven 0–10V CV envelope you can use anywhere. On top of the loaded shape you can **offset every one of the eight DX7 EG attributes** (four rates + four levels) by trimpot or CV, scale the rates to pitch with a V/oct input, and add the DX7's global LFO tremolo.

It's the DX7 envelope, freed from the oscillator — for shaping any VCA, filter, or modulation target with the unmistakable feel of FM-synth envelopes.

OP ENV is 20HP.

## The DX7 envelope, briefly

A DX7 operator envelope has **four rates (R1–R4)** and **four levels (L1–L4)**. Each stage ramps toward its level at its rate:

- **Attack →** ramp to **L1** at **R1**
- then to **L2** at **R2**
- then to **L3** at **R3**, and **hold at L3** (this is the sustain) while the gate is held
- on **gate-off →** ramp to **L4** at **R4** (the release)

So L3 is the sustain level and L4 is the release/end level (normally 0). Rates are *speeds*, not times: higher = faster. Because adjacent levels are often equal and rates saturate, small offsets sometimes have little audible effect — that's faithful DX7 behaviour, not a bug.

See the on-screen ENV display, which draws this shape live.

## Quick start

1. Right-click → load a `.syx` bank (or use the built-in default), and pick a **VOICE**.
2. Patch a **GATE** into OP ENV.
3. Take **ENV** out into a VCA/filter. The output follows the voice's carrier envelope.
4. Nudge the **R1–R4 / L1–L4** trimpots to reshape it; add CV for movement.

## Controls

Controls are grouped on the panel as two blocks of four (LEVELS on top, RATES below), each with the control's CV jack beneath it, plus VOICE/BANK and the LFO/output row.

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **L1–L4** | Offsets (−99…+99) added to the voice's four EG **levels**, clamped to the DX7 0–99 range. |
| **R1–R4** | Offsets (−99…+99) added to the voice's four EG **rates**. |
| **VOICE** | Selects the patch whose carrier envelope is used. |
| **BANK** | Selects between loaded banks. |
| **LFO** | Offsets the voice's global-LFO speed (tremolo rate). |
| **DEPTH** | Offsets the LFO amplitude-modulation depth (tremolo amount). |
| **DELAY** | Offsets the LFO delay (how long after gate-on the tremolo fades in). |
| **AM SENS** | Offsets the carrier's amplitude-modulation sensitivity (0–3); tremolo needs DEPTH **and** AM SENS **and** the LFO all non-zero. |
| **OUT LVL** | Output level / scaler for the ENV output. |

## Inputs

| Input | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **GATE** | Rising edge fires the attack; falling edge starts the release. |
| **V/OCT** | Key-tracks the envelope rates (DX7 rate scaling), so the envelope gets faster as pitch rises — patch your pitch CV here to match note length to register. |
| **L1–L4 CV / R1–R4 CV** | ±5V over the full ±99 offset range for each level / rate. |
| **VOICE CV / BANK CV** | Voice and bank selection. |
| **LFO CV / DEPTH CV** | Modulate LFO rate and tremolo depth. |
| **OUT LVL CV** | Modulate the output level. |

## Output

| Output | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **ENV** | The envelope, 0–10V, scaled by OUT LVL. |

## The display

The ENV screen draws the resolved envelope shape — the loaded voice plus your offsets — as a bright curve, with a dim data-driven backdrop marking the four levels (L1–L4) and the key-off point, and a live trace showing the envelope as it plays. It updates as you turn the trimpots, so you can dial a shape by eye.

## Release behaviour (important)

By default OP ENV behaves like an envelope generator: **gate-off returns the output to 0V**, regardless of the loaded voice's L4. This is set with the context-menu option **"Release to 0V"** (on by default).

Why it matters: in a real DX7 the release ramps to **L4** and holds there. For voices (or L4 offsets) where L4 > 0, the envelope would release to that level and stay high — correct for the hardware, but surprising for an envelope module, where it looks "stuck." Turn **"Release to 0V"** *off* to restore the authentic DX7 L4 release level (and make the L4 control meaningful as a release target).

## Context Menu

- **Release to 0V** — gate-off returns to silence (default on) vs. the authentic DX7 L4 release level (off).
- **Banks** — Load bank (.syx)…, select among loaded banks, Remove current bank.
- **LFO waveform** — From voice (default), Triangle, Saw down, Saw up, Square, Sine, Sample & hold.

Loaded banks, current bank, LFO waveform, and the release option are saved with the patch.

## Patch Ideas

**Authentic DX7 envelope on any oscillator:** load a DX7 patch you like, gate OP ENV from your sequencer, and use ENV to drive a VCA on a completely different VCO. You get the FM envelope's character without the FM tone.

**Matched pair with Operator:** play the same voice on [Operator](operator-manual.md) (take its **VCO** out) and OP ENV from the same gate — Operator gives the tone, OP ENV the envelope, and you can offset/modulate the envelope independently of the sound.

**Key-tracked dynamics:** patch your pitch CV into **V/OCT**. High notes get shorter, snappier envelopes and low notes longer ones — the DX7 rate-scaling behaviour, useful for realistic mallet/string articulation.

**Tremolo shaper:** raise AM SENS + DEPTH and pick an LFO waveform; the output gains the DX7's delayed vibrato/tremolo character that fades in after each note starts (set the fade with DELAY).

**Reshape on the fly:** modulate L2/L3 or R2/R3 with slow LFOs (via the CV jacks) to morph the envelope's body over time while keeping the attack and release fixed.

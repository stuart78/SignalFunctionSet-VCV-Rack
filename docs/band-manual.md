# Band Manual

## Overview

Band is a harmonic bandpass bank built for one specific, hard-to-do job: isolating the individual harmonics of a sound. Inspired by a technique Suzanne Ciani has described — starting with a low, harmonically-rich wave and using a very narrow bandpass to pull out one harmonic at a time — Band makes that effortless.

The trick is that **harmonics are linearly spaced** (f0, 2·f0, 3·f0 …), not exponential, so a normal 1V/oct filter makes them fiddly to land on. Band instead locks each of its four bands to an **integer harmonic** of a shared fundamental, so every band sits dead-on a partial, every time. It can find that fundamental automatically from the incoming audio, or track it via 1V/oct.

Band is 24HP.

## How It Works

- A shared **fundamental** `f0` is established (auto-detected from the audio, or set by TUNE + V/OCT).
- Each of the four bands (**A, B, C, D**) selects an integer **harmonic** *N*; its bandpass center is computed as `N × f0` — so it lands exactly on that partial.
- **WIDTH** sets bandwidth as a *fraction of f0*, giving constant absolute bandwidth: every harmonic isolates equally cleanly (the internal Q auto-scales with N).
- Each band has its own colour (A blue, B green, C orange, D purple) carried into the on-screen spectrum so you always know which control owns which harmonic.

## Controls

### Per band (×4: A, B, C, D)
| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Level** (top knob) | Output level of that band |
| **Harmonic** (middle knob) | Which integer harmonic this band isolates (snaps 1–32; 1 = the fundamental) |
| **Enable** (button + LED) | Switch the band in/out (fast anti-click fade) |

### Global (bottom row)
| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **TUNE** | Manual fundamental, standard 1V/oct convention (0V = C4) |
| **WIDTH** | Bandpass bandwidth as a fraction of f0. Narrow = razor-thin single harmonic; wider = neighbours bleed in (controlled "impurity"); >1 = clusters |

## Inputs

| Input | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **IN** | Audio in — the rich source you're isolating harmonics from |
| **V/OCT** | Fundamental pitch, 1V/oct (matches a standard oscillator; used in manual mode) |
| **SHIFT** | Global continuous harmonic shift — slides *all* bands between harmonics at once (1V = 1 harmonic) for scanning/impurity |
| **W-CV** | Width modulation |
| **Per band: Level CV** | Modulates that band's level (10V → +full) |
| **Per band: Harmonic CV** | Continuously shifts that band's harmonic (1V = 1 harmonic) |
| **Per band: Enable gate** | Gate ≥1V forces the band on (overrides its button when patched) |

## Outputs

| Output | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **MIX** | Sum of all enabled bands (each × its level) |
| **POLY** | Each band on its own polyphonic channel (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4) — spatialize or process harmonics separately |

## The Display

A spectrum analyzer of the incoming audio (FFT) drawn on a **harmonic axis** (frequency ÷ f0), so the spectral peaks line up with the harmonic gridlines. Each band is drawn as a coloured "bell" sitting on its harmonic, height = level, labelled with its letter and harmonic number (e.g. `A5` = band A on harmonic 5). The readout at the bottom-left shows the current `f0` in Hz, with **AUTO** shown when the pitch is being auto-detected.

## Auto-Follow vs. Manual

- **Auto-follow (default, context menu):** Band detects the source's fundamental directly from the audio (FFT autocorrelation) and locks the harmonic grid to it — feed any rich wave and the bands snap onto its real harmonics with no tuning. As you play a melody into IN, the whole bank tracks. (V/OCT and TUNE are ignored while auto-follow is locked.)
- **Manual:** turn auto-follow off and set the fundamental with TUNE + V/OCT. Because Band uses the standard 1V/oct reference, patching the same pitch CV into both your oscillator and Band's V/OCT keeps the harmonics aligned exactly at every note — the most precise option, especially for high harmonics.

## Context Menu

- **Follow input pitch (auto-lock harmonics)** — toggle auto-detection (default on).
- **Filter slope** — 4-pole (steep, default) or 2-pole (gentler).

## Patch Ideas

**Ciani-style harmonic isolation:** feed a low saw or pulse (~30–110 Hz) into IN. Leave auto-follow on. Turn WIDTH right down, then set A/B/C/D to different harmonics — each rings out a single partial. Bring WIDTH up slightly for a breathier, less pure tone.

**Additive re-voicing:** isolate harmonics 1, 2, 3, 5 across the four bands and ride their Levels (or modulate with LFOs/envelopes) to re-balance the timbre of any source in real time.

**Spatial harmonics:** take the POLY output into four VCAs/panners (or a poly VCA) and place each harmonic in its own position in the stereo field.

**Harmonic sequencing:** sequence the per-band Harmonic CVs (1V/harmonic) or the global SHIFT to step the bands up and down the harmonic series in time with your patch.

**Vocoder-ish movement:** modulate WIDTH and SHIFT slowly with LFOs while the source plays — the bank rakes across the partials for evolving, formant-like motion.

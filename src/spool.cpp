// Spool -- four short tapes, one transport, and no rewind.
//
// After the Mellotron, and departing from it in the one place that matters. A
// Mellotron's tapes are pulled across the head while a key is held and are
// SPRUNG BACK when it is released, which is why a note can only last eight
// seconds and why every press starts from the same place. Here the tape stays
// where it stopped. Press again and it carries on from there, so a repeated
// stab walks through the loop instead of replaying the same instant, and the
// phrase you get out is a function of how you played rather than of where the
// file happens to begin.
//
// That one change is what makes RESET necessary rather than a convenience: if
// the tape never returns to the start, something has to be able to send it
// there.
//
// PITCH IS VARISPEED, NOT TRANSPOSITION. V/OCT changes how fast the tape runs,
// so it moves the pitch AND the loop's period together, exactly as it does on a
// machine with a capstan. An octave down is twice the loop length. Nothing here
// time-stretches, because a Mellotron cannot.
//
// ONE TRANSPORT, FOUR TAPES. WOW and FLUTTER are shared, not per loop, because
// they are the motor: one capstan, one set of speed errors, imposed on
// everything it drives. Four independent wobbles sound like four machines, and
// the instrument is one machine. (Wheel makes the same argument about its one
// rosined wheel bowing six strings.)
//
// THE RAMP IS A SPEED, NOT A FADE. A tape machine's start is the capstan
// getting up to speed, so the ramp scales the playback RATE, which glides the
// pitch up into place and back down on stop. At 0 it is instant; at 20 ms every
// note has a tiny sag on the way in. It is also what stops the transport
// clicking, because a tape resumed mid-waveform from a standstill is a step.
//
// THE TRANSPORT FOLLOWS THE ENVELOPE, NOT THE GATE. If it stopped when the gate
// fell, a long release would be releasing a FROZEN sample -- a held DC value
// fading out, which is not a tape stopping, it is a click with a slow tail. So
// the tape rolls while the envelope is above zero and only then spins down.

	// a window apart carry the same waveform at different phases, and where
	// the fade hands over they cancel. On pitched material the tape's own
	// period is known -- the detector has already measured it -- so THE TAPS
	// ARE KEPT A WHOLE NUMBER OF PERIODS APART. Then the two reads are the same
	// waveform at the same phase, the fade is between two copies of one thing,
	// and there is nothing to cancel. The window is 2kP with k the smallest that
	// makes it at least 20 ms, so a high note does not hand over every couple
	// of milliseconds on a period that is only nearly right. That is Lent's
	// method (1989), the pitch-synchronous half of PSOLA, done with a sweep
	// rather than a grain scheduler.
	//
	// Unpitched material has no period to keep, so it gets a 50 ms window and

	// length moves nothing that can be heard. Re-sizing at any other moment
	// would jump both taps.
	//

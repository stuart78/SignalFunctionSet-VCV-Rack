// Shared parts of a waveguide string.
//
// A vibrating string, as a delay loop: the delay length is the pitch, an in-loop
// lowpass takes the treble first (as a real string does), a chain of allpasses
// stretches the partials sharp (stiffness), and a DC blocker sits INSIDE the
// loop — on the input it would do nothing, because it is the recirculation that
// accumulates the offset.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: the loop body itself. It is eight lines, and in
// Loom the bridge coupling is injected part-way through it — so folding it into
// a shared step() would either change the order of two float additions (which is
// not associative, and Loom's tuning was verified bit-exact) or need a signature
// contorted enough to be worse than the eight lines it replaced. Excitation is
// out for the same reason: a bow and a pick have nothing in common.
//
// So this is the delay line, the exact phase-delay maths, a filter, and a
// limiter — the parts that are the same everywhere and will stay that way.

// =============================================================================
// Slide — an electric lap steel.
//
// Eight waveguide strings stopped by a steel bar rather than by frets. The bar
// is the instrument: a single rigid object lying across every string at once,
// so it moves them all by the same ratio and the tuning's intervals survive
// intact. That is why lap steel is played in 6th and 7th tunings — a straight
// bar is already a chord.
//
// What makes it read as a SLIDE rather than as a pitch bend, in order of how
// much each contributes:
//
//   1. The glide is RATE-based, not time-based. A hand moves along the neck at
//      roughly constant speed, so a twelfth takes twice as long as a fifth.
//      Nearly every synth portamento is constant-time-per-interval, and that is
//      most of why synth glides do not sound like slides.
//   2. (Was SCRAPE, and it is gone. Two models — bandpassed noise, then an
//      impulse train at the winding-crossing rate — and neither sounded like a
//      bar on a string. The physics was right and the result was still wrong.)
//   3. The pickup is at a FIXED point in space while the speaking length
//      changes, so its position as a fraction of the string grows as the bar
//      goes up the neck and the tone hollows out. Loom's comb is a fixed
//      fraction, which is right for a fretted instrument and wrong for this.
//   4. The bar is a lossy, mass-loaded termination — it rests on the string
//      rather than clamping it against wood, so it returns less treble than a
//      fret does.
//   5. Vibrato is a rocking motion: wide, and centred on the pitch rather than
//      bending up to it.
//
// SLANT angles the bar across the strings. It is the technique that gets major,
// minor and dominant voicings out of one tuning without retuning, and it is the
// reason this is its own module rather than a glide mode on Loom.

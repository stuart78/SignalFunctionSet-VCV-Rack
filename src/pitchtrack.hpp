// Fundamental detection by autocorrelation, computed as IFFT(|FFT|^2).
//
// The period is the SHORTEST lag carrying a strong peak. That ordering is the
// whole trick: taking the LARGEST peak instead finds the sub-octave about as
// often as the octave, because a periodic signal correlates just as well at
// twice its period. Harmonic-product spectra have the mirror-image problem and
// need octave hacks bolted on; this needs none.
//
// Lifted from Band, which proved it. Band still carries its own copy because
// its FFT is shared with the display's spectrum and separating the two is a
// change to a shipping module; it should be migrated onto this header when
// something else is being done to it anyway. Until then, a fix here belongs
// there too.

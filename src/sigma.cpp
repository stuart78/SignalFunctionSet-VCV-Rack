// =============================================================================
// Sigma — a tone SUMMED from sixteen partials you can move independently.
//
// Named for the summation sign, because that is the whole operation: there is
// no oscillator here making a waveform and no filter taking anything away. The
// output is nothing but a sum of sines, and every control is a statement about
// what goes into that sum.
//
// After the Crumar GDS (1980), which commercialised Hal Alles' Bell Labs
// machine. The GDS gave every oscillator a sixteen-stage amplitude envelope AND
// a sixteen-stage frequency envelope, plus two complete envelope sets
// interpolated by velocity. That is 512 breakpoints for sixteen partials, and it
// is why the thing needed a $30,000 computer bolted to it to be programmable at
// all. A Eurorack panel has no answer to that, so this takes the behaviour and
// leaves the mechanism.
//
// TWO NUMBERS PER PARTIAL, NOT AN ENVELOPE: depth and RATE. Depth alone is not
// enough and that is the thing to get right -- a shared envelope scaled only in
// level gives a spectral fade, bright to dark, but every partial still ends at
// the same instant. What makes a struck tone sound struck is that high partials
// die SOONER, which needs the envelope to run at a different rate per partial.
// It is the same thing Kit's modal damping and Loom's in-loop lowpass do.
//
// THE PANEL IS SPREADS; THE SCREEN IS THE EXCEPTIONS. Every macro turned out to
// be the same shape of thing: a curve across the partial index. TILT is a spread
// of level, STRETCH of pitch, WIDTH of pan, ENV RATE of envelope rate, ENV
// SPREAD of envelope start time, and each LFO's spread is the same idea in
// phase. So the panel is one gesture -- how does this attribute vary from the
// fundamental to the sixteenth partial -- repeated per attribute, and the screen
// holds the per-partial deviations from those curves.
//
// VELOCITY MORPHS THE SPECTRUM RATHER THAN SCALING IT. Two complete level sets,
// soft and loud, crossfaded. A quiet note is a different timbre, not a quieter
// one. It is the least-copied idea in the GDS and the cheapest to steal.
//

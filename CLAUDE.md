## Project Overview

This is a VCV Rack plugin called "Signal Function Set" that provides modular synthesizer modules. Currently shipping:

1. **Drift** — Phase-shifted LFO with offset, attenuation, and Lorenz-attractor chaos
2. **GSX** — Granular synthesis (Barry Truax GSX system, 1985-86)
3. **Fugue** — 8-step harmonic deviation sequencer with three CV/gate voices
4. **Fugue X** — Expander for Fugue: per-voice steps/range/sleep/probability
5. **Phase** — Dual sample looper with sleep-based phase drift + live recording
6. **Overtone** — Additive VCO with 8 togglable harmonics, even/odd filter, binary-mask CV
7. **Intone** — CHANT/FOF formant synthesis voice with vowel morphing
8. **Tine** — Tunable 3rd-order pingable resonator (Gamelan Resonator circuit)
9. **Meter** — Time-signature-aware musical clock with subdivision outputs and per-output swing
10. **Meter X** (slug `MeterX`) — Expander for Meter: 24 PPQN clock, Run gate, and Bar / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 / 128-bar trigger outputs, each with an activity LED. Reads Meter's clock over the expander bus (`src/meter-messages.hpp`)
11. **Beat** — Per-voice pattern sequencer (8×16) with on-screen step/velocity/accent/probability editing
12. **Note** — Monophonic CV/gate pattern sequencer with 12-note pitch matrix and scale/root selection
13. **Swell** — Ping-driven additive A/D envelope with stacked rises
14. **Shift** — 4-output CV shift register with per-lane delay/cascade modes
15. **Wave** — Polaroid wavetable voice *(WIP, hidden — not ready)*: live parametric shape + 8 FIFO snapshots + WANDER macro
16. **Vac** — Semi-stable A/R envelope with vactrol-like timing drift (log-symmetric STAB)
17. **Muse** — Faithful Triadex Muse recreation (Fredkin/Minsky 1972) — 4 theme + 4 interval sliders
18. **Gravity** — Multi-mode chaos engine (pendulum / gravity well / billiards / Hungry Man Pac-Man maze / LOGO Turtle / Pattern spirograph-rose generator) with X/Y, radius, angle, sector CVs and ray-crossing gates
19. **Band** — Harmonic bandpass bank: 4 bands each lock to an integer harmonic of a shared (auto-detected or 1V/oct) fundamental; per-band level/harmonic/enable + CV, spectrum display
20. **Cycle** (slug `Cycle`) — Bar-synced quad LFO: four channels (A-D) with morphable shape + depth, locked to a musical bar via clock + bar inputs (free-run Hz unpatched); global phase spread + stability; per-pair SHAPE/SCALE **link buttons** (a linked channel follows its group's leftmost leader, its own pot becomes an offset from the leader — circular values wrap, bounded ones clamp); per-channel uni/bipolar outs
21. **Operator** (slug `Operator`; the source is still `src/bell.cpp` and the class `Bell`, from before the rename) — DX7-style 6-operator FM voice on the msfa engine; loads .syx cartridges, polyphonic, AUDIO/VCO/ENV-follower outs, tabbed operators/envelope display
22. **OP ENV** (slug `OpEnv`) — standalone DX7 operator envelope generator; loads a voice's carrier EG, offsets all 8 rate/level attributes via trimpot/CV, V/oct rate scaling, LFO tremolo, "Release to 0V" option
23. **Arrange** (slug `Arrange`, formerly Phrase) — song-form / arrangement sequencer: a single horizontal chain of 8 phrases (bar-length sections) advancing linearly (next active, wraps). Each phrase carries a bar length (4×4 grid, 1-16), enable, root + scale + BPM (trimpots; **LED link dots between columns cascade BPM/root/scale independently per row, default linked** — a linked phrase inherits its group's leftmost leader's value exactly; break the link for independence), a **GATE out that stays high while that phrase plays** (row under the trimpots), and **4 channel enables** (colored bars on screen: blue/green/orange-red/purple). The 4 channels are per-instrument clock buses in a dark inset — each column has a clock-division trimpot (÷1..÷16, bar-aligned) above its divided CLOCK out, then BAR, RESET (fires on master reset + channel re-enable), and EOC (arrangement wrap) outs, all muted on phrases where the channel is off (instruments drop in/out per phrase); the master outs (BPM 0.01V/BPM → Meter's "BPM CV absolute", Root + Scale CV in Note convention, Phrase index 1V/phrase) sit at the inset's bottom. BAR in (advances the arrangement — Meter's BAR out) + CLOCK in (divided per channel) + RESET in/btn bottom-left. No master Bar/Clock outs — Meter is the source; instruments take the channel outs. 34HP. The arrangement brain above Beat/Note/Chance.
24. **Chance** (slug `Chance`) — Generative melodic walk sequencer (26HP, external clock): a seeded deterministic core melody + a BRANCH probability of straying to a neighbour (non-cascading, so the core always shows through); Markov note choice (`src/chance-markov.hpp`); GRAV/DRIFT = direction + move size; Rest/Hold/Leap/Ratchet shaping each with CV; **START/END** set the play window — trimpot + CV jack at 1V/step, and setting END *before* START plays the window backwards; GATE LEN + GLIDE live in the context menu (menu sliders) rather than on the panel; 8 seeded patterns (micro-waveform, per-step 3-state gates off/gate/tie, repeat count, normal-vs-reseed mode) rotating at cycle level; Harmony 2nd voice (fixed interval or Varied); on-screen editing (click a pattern to load it into the walk; gate edits apply immediately mid-cycle)
25. **Record** (slug `Record`) — Auto-sampler (16HP): drives any voice with V/OCT+GATE+VEL, records the stereo return across a note × velocity sweep, and writes WAVs + an `.sfz`. Audition mode, round-robins, loop-point detection, latency calibration, wait-for-silence, mono/stereo + 16/24/32-bit. **WAVs are written on the GUI thread** (`RecordWidget::step()`), never from `process()`
26. **Play** (slug `Play`) — Polyphonic multisample player (16HP): loads `.sfz` or DecentSampler `.dspreset` (both parsed inline in play.cpp) into a shared 16-voice engine; velocity layers, round-robins, loops-while-held, per-note tune; note-off releases by default (menu "One-shot (play through)" for drums); multi-instrument via INSTR knob/CV; poly V/OCT+GATE read with `getPolyVoltage`. **INSTR CV and LEVEL CV are polyphonic** (2026-09): `instrumentFor(chan)` / `levelFor(chan)` read each voice's own channel, so a poly INSTR cable plays one instrument per note and a poly LEVEL cable is a VCA per voice (`Voice::lvl`, refreshed every sample, folded into the voice gain; the output stage no longer applies LEVEL). `curInstrument` is the DISPLAYED channel's (`dispChan`, menu "Screen shows", saved), for the screen and the UI audition, and only voices on that instrument are marked on its keys; `noteOn()` still reads it, pointed at the channel's instrument for the call, because the harness extracts `noteOn` verbatim by signature. The **INSTR knob's travel is the instruments that are loaded** (`syncInstrParam()` re-sets `maxValue` on every structural change) and it reads back as `3/6 Kalimba` rather than a bare index — but it is configured **wide (0..15) and narrowed afterwards, never the other way round**, because `Module::paramsFromJson()` restores through `ParamQuantity`, which CLAMPS to the range in force, and it runs BEFORE `dataFromJson()` loads the instruments; configuring it narrow would clip the saved knob position on every patch load. Floored at 1, since `maxValue` must exceed `minValue`. **WAV + FLAC** samples (dr_wav / dr_flac, implementation TU in `src/dr_flac.cpp`), decoded to **int16** and loaded on a **background thread** (`startLoader()`; regions are silent until their `loaded` flag flips, and every structural change to `instruments` calls `joinLoader()` first) — third-party piano libraries run to gigabytes. SFZ compatibility: `\` path separators are translated, `trigger != attack` and CC-gated regions are dropped (Play has no release-trigger or pedal state, and leaving them in makes the round-robin play resonances instead of notes), keyswitched libraries keep only the `sw_default` articulation, and `offset` / `end` / `pan` / `pitch_keytrack` / `amp_veltrack` / `global_volume` are honoured. **DecentSampler:** a `.dslibrary` is a **ZIP**, and Rack's only unarchiver runs `tar --zstd` — libRack exports no zlib or libarchive symbol either, so Play carries **miniz** (`src/miniz.c`, MIT, vendored beside dr_wav/dr_flac) and unzips the pack itself into `<Rack user dir>/SignalFunctionSet/dslibrary/`; archive entry names are validated against `..` and absolute paths before anything is written. A `.dsbundle` usually holds **several** `.dspreset`s (Marxophone 6, Phase8 25) and every one of them is loaded as its own instrument, sorted — taking "the first" meant the bundle loaded whichever patch the filesystem named first and said nothing about the rest; the patch stores one path per *load*, not per instrument (`Instrument::srcHead`), or reloading a 6-preset bundle comes back with 36. `start`/`end` are a **window into the file**, not decoration — libraries that record several takes in one pass and slice them afterwards carry their trims there, and they are written as floats. **Every failure used to be a log line the user never saw**: the module kept showing the instrument it already had, which is what "silently failing" looks like from the outside. `dispErr` now says it on the panel, over either tab (the old `dispInfo` only drew on the piano tab, so even "loading…" was invisible on the default grid). Verify with `tools/play-instrument-harness.py`, which extracts the parsers, the loader, `noteOn()` and the voice mixer **verbatim** from play.cpp and reports, per instrument, whether a note-on actually renders audible samples. The display **leads with an instrument list** (left tab, and where a new module opens) over a compact LOAD button pinned to the foot, in place of the 88-key map that used to be there — the map was a picture of what the grid already shows in colour, on a surface you could not play as well as the grid, while the thing you come to Play to do was buried in the right-click menu. Rows carry a per-instrument region/loaded count (the header only ever spoke for the selected one), click selects, the remove cross is drawn **only on the hovered row** so it cannot be misclicked, and the file dialog is deferred to `PlayDisplay::step()` — opened from inside an event handler it eats the mouse-release that belongs to the click that opened it and Rack is left thinking the button is down (Record defers its folder prompt for the same reason). The error strip sits under the **header**, because the foot belongs to the LOAD button and covering that covers what you need after a failed load. Two contrast rules learned on screen: every colour on a row must clear the ROW's background, not the screen's — the dim grey that reads as secondary on #1a1a2e vanishes into a selected row's blue — and the remove mark is **two strokes, not a glyph**, since a lowercase `x` occupies only the lower half of the font's ascender-to-descender band and `NVG_ALIGN_MIDDLE` centres the band. A NEW module opens on the list (`kbView = 0`), since a new Play has nothing in it; the browser thumbnail still draws the grid, because `module == NULL` never reads `kbView`
27. **Fill** (slug `Fill`) — Auto-playing 8-channel drum sequencer (32HP, external clock): loads every `res/patterns/*.json` bank (canonical file first, so its first set stays the default) plus user banks from `<Rack user dir>/SignalFunctionSet/patterns/`. One internal **pressure** value accumulates per bar and vents as a fill, driving both the intensity tier (sparse/main/lift, phrase-latched) and a seeded variation layer; the EXTRAS knob is a hard cap on engine-added notes and each set's `vary` limits how far its identity may bend. Playback is **clock-driven** (steps fire on CLOCK edges, `clocksPerBar` measured between BARs) so it freezes the moment the clock stops. Five-tab display (PATTERN · GENRE · REGION · USER · FAVS); favourites persist plugin-wide in `fill-favorites.json`; drum-patterns.com `.txt` exports import natively. Per-channel gate/velocity/accent + NUM/DEN outs feeding Meter's "Time signature CV absolute"
28. **Chime** (slug `Chime`) — Eight-note resonating drone machine (28HP), after a xylophone whose resonator tubes rotate beneath the bars: each note has a semi-free bidirectional LFO ("tube rotation") and blooms as its tube swings through centre. Excitation is a continuous **bow ↔ strike** blend (struck at every centre crossing — two per rotation, as the mechanism gives); RELATE sets how the eight rates relate (ramp / stepped / random / **ripple**, where a crossing excites its neighbours and blooms travel down the row); per-note weight = strike probability, per-note swing attenuator trades arc width for strike rate. Pitch **latches at note boundaries**, so retuning never bends a sounding note. 8 tube-LFO CV outs, 8 audio outs, stereo mix, poly V/OCT + GATE
29. **Crystal** (slug `Crystal`) — 3D echo chamber shaped like a real crystal (28HP). Sixteen habits built as intersections of half-spaces from symmetry-expanded Miller-index normals (cube {100}, octahedron {111}, dodecahedron {110}, sphalerite tetrahedron, pyrite {210} pyritohedron, quartz, the low-symmetry systems) ordered simple→complex, ending in four **clusters** — several whole crystals intergrown, so a ray can be trapped in one point or wander between them. Traced by **letting rays loose** (7 rays × 26 bounces per emitter, deterministic fan): every wall strike sheds an echo toward each of four interior listeners = the **quad outs**. Tracing runs on a worker (~50ms) and the audio thread adopts the tap set with a crossfade; per sample it reads a multitap delay, six recirculating "pockets" per emitter, and an FDN tail sized by Sabine on the crystal's own volume/area. CHAMBER keeps real acoustic timing, **DELAY** keeps the geometry's arrival ratios but stretches them to musical times (SIZE = delay time). Two emitters (stereo in → quad out) navigable by X/Y **velocity** CV; internal exciter is Chime's struck bar, so fully dry is a bare resonator. Rotation is camera-only

30. **Loom** (slug `Loom`) — Eight-string resonator (28HP). Each string is a digital waveguide: delay loop for pitch, in-loop lowpass, a 4-section allpass chain for stiffness, and a comb on the **output tap** for pluck position. Filter phase delay is evaluated **exactly at the string's fundamental**, not at DC, or the strings run sharp. **EXCITE is a continuous axis** — HAMMER · PLUCK · BOW · WIND as nodes; at a pure node the code path (including how many random numbers it draws) is identical to the single-exciter version, so pluck and hammer stay **bit-exact**. **Bow** = Smith friction curve, and three things make it work everywhere rather than only where it was tuned: (1) the curve's input is **normalised by the string's own envelope**, so its operating point does not drift with pitch/decay/damping; (2) a **pressure regulator** holds the string at a target amplitude — an unregulated friction model settled anywhere between silent and pinned to the clamp, taking up to 6 s to get there, and *every measurement taken before ~5 s is measuring the build-up, not the tone*; (3) the regulator drives **force, not bow speed**, because the friction curve is non-monotonic in speed and a controller pushing on speed sails past the peak. Bow speed sets loudness, not whether it speaks; **hair noise** is load-bearing (without it the string locks to its sub-octave). **WIND** is an aeolian harp: vortex shedding drives a *narrow* band that **moves with the gust** (Strouhal), so the harp climbs and falls between partials — fundamental ~26 dB down, dominant partial roams 3→8. A fixed band just sounds like a filtered bow. **DAMP is floored at 10× each string's own pitch**: as an absolute cutoff it filtered a high string below its second partial, and with so few partials left the pluck-position comb's null (near the 4.5th) removed what remained — a dark high bowed string made almost no sound. **COUPLE**: string *motion* (not the combed pickup, which peaks at +6 dB and howls in a loop) feeds a bridge bus; each string trades a band-limited fraction, `x += k·(bus − ownLowpassed)`. Only the transmitted band is damped, the in-phase mode has gain 1 (unconditionally stable). Ceiling **0.06** — 0.35 cost 89% of the sustain and bought *less* ring. Output is **soft-clipped** (linear to ±6 V, asymptotic to ±10): eight bowed strings have a crest factor no pluck approaches. Display is the instrument: PLAY strums with the mouse (Y = where along the string), six tabs edit one attribute per string by height. 8 gate ins + poly VEL, 8 string outs + stereo mix, 12 arpeggio patterns. **Known gap:** strings tuned near the very top (+36 st ≈ 523 Hz) bow much quieter than the rest.
31. **Key** (slug `Key`) — Quantizer that takes its key from the patch (14HP). Reads **ROOT** (1V/oct, semitone-quantized) and **SCALE** (1V per scale) in the plugin convention, so one key change travels to Arrange, Note, Chance, Muse, Fugue, Loom and this together. Four channels, each **polyphonic** (16ch), all sharing one key. **Each channel IS a scale** (columns MAIN / SUB 1 / SUB 2 / SUB 3; `subFor(c) = c`, and `SUB_PARAM` is retired in place since 2026-09, when a poly IN per channel made choosing redundant). Per channel: IN, TRIG, **OFFSET** (scale *degrees* by default, so +2 moves two steps up the scale and stays in key; semitones via the menu), OUT. (Per-channel **CHG** triggers were retired with the 2026-08 panel: the enum slots stay, because outputs serialise by index.) A **TRIG per channel** (polyphonic: trigger channel N resamples voice N, a narrower cable repeats its last channel) turns it into a sample-and-hold; the old global TRIG_INPUT is retired in place. **IN and TRIG both normal left to right**, and any new cable breaks the chain from that point (X.X. reads 1-1-3-3). The two together are the patch that motivated both: one pitch and one clock into channel 1, four sub-scales and offsets off the same line. **Three SUB-SCALES** filter the selection, stored as masks over the parent's **degree indices** rather than absolute pitches — so `{0,2,4}` is a triad in Major (C E G), still a triad in Minor (C D♯ G), and follows the root (D♯ G A♯ in E♭). A sub-scale is a *role within the key*, not a set of notes; an empty one falls back to the parent rather than muting. A menu option, **"Sub-scales may leave the key"** (off by default), makes the out-of-scale cells clickable so a sub-scale can carry an accidental. Those picks live in a **second store, `subChrom`, as semitone offsets from the root** rather than degree indices, because a note chosen for being outside the scale has no degree to be stored as: they transpose with ROOT and do *not* follow a SCALE change. A ring round the cell marks one on screen. The option is inert on a non-12-tone scale, where there is no chromatic to pick from. **Degrees are capped at `KEY_MAXDEG` = 256 and the sub-scale masks are `DegMask` (four 64-bit words), because the cap was hit twice** — 24, then 64, each time by a real Scala file (a 79-note MOS of 159-tET came in at 64 and lost its top quarter of the octave to one dead region) — and each time the mask type was the second limit hiding behind the first; a patch that stored one integer per mask still loads. In the strip state the sub-scale cells sit at the same pitch-linear x as the degree lines above them (uneven on a just scale, and correctly so) and are bars most of the row's height, and the footer names a note by degree and repeat (`31 (5)`) rather than the nearest 12-tone name. **Scala (.scl) files load** from the menu and occupy SCALE index `NUM_SCALES` (0..18 stay exactly the canonical list, so cross-module SCALE CV is unaffected); cents *and* ratios parse, and the **period need not be an octave** — Bohlen-Pierce comes in as 13 degrees repeating at 19.02 semitones (3/1). The parsed scale is saved into the patch alongside the path, so it survives the file moving — and **the file wins when it is still there**: `dataFromJson` re-parses the path when it resolves and only falls back to the saved copy, because a copy saved by an older build with a lower degree cap was truncated and reloaded truncated forever. Menu items **Sub-scales: every degree** (`DegMask::fill()`, and NOT a 32-bit constant — that dropped degrees 32–52 of Fokker's 53), **Reset sub-scales** and **Revert keyboard to the selected scale** act on the masks directly. **Nothing here is a 12-bit pitch mask**: Harmonic series, Pelog and Slendro carry fractional intervals and Scala can carry anything, so the quantizer works in "semitones within one period" against real floats. The screen has **two states, and shows one or the other** (`Key::chromaticKey()`): the **keyboard** when the period is 12 semitones and every degree lands within a cent of a semitone, otherwise the **region strip**. Harmonic series, Pelog, Slendro and every Scala file therefore get the strip, which is linear in pitch across one period so the gaps between its degree lines *are* the snap regions — the keyboard could only round them. The keyboard is drawn from **C whatever the root is** (you read a keyboard by its shape), 5 upper and 7 lower circles on a 13-slot grid whose gap is the missing black key between E and F, with the root marked by an inset dot. The three sub-scale rows sit under it as **12 chromatic cells aligned to their own note** in the keyboard state, and as **one cell per degree** in the strip state. Clicking a key forks a **custom mask**; clicking a sub-scale cell toggles the degree at that pitch class, or the chromatic pick when free mode is on. Screen geometry is transcribed from `design/Key/*.svg` in the design's own 760x480 units and scaled once, because the panel's screen is the same ratio. Hysteresis (menu, default 12 cents) is abandoned whenever the key *or the channel's sub-scale* changes, or a held note would survive outside its new scale. **Key is the master key control**: **ROOT OUT** (1V/oct) and **SCALE OUT** drive every other module's ROOT/SCALE inputs. SCALE OUT is **polyphonic** — channel 0 is the plain 1V-per-scale index every existing module already reads (they all call `getVoltage()`, which returns channel 0 regardless of channel count, so the extension is invisible to them), channel 1 is the period in volts, and channels 2+ are the degrees as 1V/oct offsets from the root. That is how a microtonal or Scala scale reaches another module at all: the index rides on channel 0 as a lossy summary (the nearest canonical scale by pitch-class content — Pelog resolves to Phrygian), and the real scale rides behind it. Key's own SCALE **input** reads the extension when present, so Keys chain and the whole key crosses intact, non-octave period and all; a stray poly cable is validated and rejected rather than misread. 14 degrees max (16 channels less index and period). See `docs/conventions/scales.md`.

32. **Slide** (slug `Slide`) — Electric lap steel (26HP). Eight waveguide strings stopped by a **steel bar** rather than frets. The bar is one rigid object lying across every string, so it moves them all by the same ratio and the tuning's intervals survive — which is why lap steel lives in 6th and 7th tunings (C6, E7, E13, A6): a straight bar is already a chord. **SLANT** angles the bar across the strings, the technique that gets major, minor and dominant voicings out of one tuning without retuning; it is the reason this is its own module rather than a glide mode on Loom. What makes it read as a slide rather than a pitch bend, in order: (1) **GLIDE is rate-based, not time-based** — a hand crosses the neck at roughly constant speed, so a twelfth takes 2.4× as long as a fifth; nearly every synth portamento is constant-time-per-interval and that is most of why synth glides don't sound like slides; (2) *(a SCRAPE model was tried twice — bandpassed noise, then an impulse train at the winding-crossing rate — and dropped: the physics is right and neither sounded like a bar on a string; the param is retired in place so indices do not move)*; (3) the **pickup is fixed in space** while the speaking length changes, so its position as a fraction of the string runs 14%→48% up the neck and the comb null walks from the 7th harmonic to the 2nd — the tone hollows as you climb (Loom's comb is a fixed fraction, right for a fretted instrument and wrong for this); (4) the bar is a **lossy, mass-loaded termination**, returning less treble than a fret clamping against wood; (5) vibrato is a **rocking** motion, wide and centred on the pitch rather than bending up to it. The "body" is a magnetic **pickup**, not a soundboard: a resonant lowpass (coil inductance against cable capacitance) with TONE moving the peak 1.6–6.2 kHz, then amp DRIVE. Display is a **fretboard lying flat** — strings horizontal, logarithmic fret spacing, the bar drawn as a line whose *angle* is the slant, and the segment behind the bar drawn dead. Drag the bar with the mouse; hover across the strings to pick them. Clocked fingerpicking **rolls** (forward, backward, alternating, pinch…) — and a **mono GATE is one stroke, never a strum**: the solved string in melody mode, otherwise one step of the selected roll, since an unbidden eight-string strum is something to ask for (pick the Strum pattern) rather than something that should happen to you. Poly GATE/VEL, stereo mix + 8-channel poly out. Shares `src/waveguide.hpp` with Loom. Signal chain: a **volume pedal** (SWELL per note, plus a VOL input) that swells in *past* the pick attack — the missing transient is what makes a steel cry, and it is the one thing a slide model can do that a portamento cannot fake; **COUPLE**, Loom's bridge bus ported over, for the sympathetic halo Slide previously had none of; and a menu **pickup character** where Horseshoe adds a broad midrange band under the coil resonance, because bark and honk is a wide lift and no single resonant lowpass makes one wherever you put its corner. **LEGATO REACH** (menu) is how far the bar will travel to keep a held note on the string it is already sounding on, in frets, before it gives up and crosses. It exists because a steel player does not lift the bar for a note that arrives while the last one is still ringing, they move it, and that is where the cry comes from. It also fixes a real bug: **nothing in Slide picks on a note change** (every `pick()` comes from a gate edge, a roll, the mouse or Slide X), so when the solver moved a held voice to another string, that string had no energy in it and the string still ringing got dragged to whatever pitch the new bar position gave it. Measured on a held C major scale in C6, the last three notes came out a third and a fifth flat. A forced cross now re-picks. The control is a **reach in frets, not a weight**: the first attempt lerped a stickiness factor into the cost and saturated by 0.5, so half the knob did nothing — the same failure as Slice's SHAPE. As a budget it sweeps properly, taking a leaping line from 7 string crossings to 0 and bar travel from 5 frets to 21 across its range, while a stepwise line correctly stays on one string above about 1 fret. 0 is the pre-2026-08 behaviour. Bar travel is an **S-curve scaled to the distance** — a fixed deceleration window makes a short move all ease and a long one a hard ramp with a nub on the end. Auto-play rolls carry **per-step accents** — the thumb is a heavier finger than the index, so bass strokes land harder and the stroke that starts a roll hardest; DYN brings in that shape first and note-to-note jitter second, because jitter alone humanises when the accents fall but not what shape they make.

33. **Slice** (slug `Slice`) — Cuts a stereo stream onto a grid and reworks each piece (22HP). Sixty seconds of audio go into a circular buffer (30 / 60 / 120s on the menu, which matters because REACH counts up to 32 bars and at 120 BPM that is 64 seconds — with the old 30s buffer two thirds of that knob's travel was unreachable; 120s costs 44MB at 48k and 176MB at 192k, per instance, which is why it is a choice). **Resizing hands the buffer over rather than reallocating in `process()`**: the UI thread builds the new vectors, the audio thread takes them with a `std::vector::swap` (a pointer exchange, no allocation), and the widget frees the old memory on the next frame; a grid of slices runs over it, 10ms to 1s each, free-running from LENGTH or measured from CLOCK (which then takes over, and the screen tags the readout CLK or LEN so you can see which is in charge). The clock rate runs /8 /4 /2 **x1** x2 x4 x8 with x1 dead centre. **WHAT happens and HOW OFTEN are two knobs, not one**: EFFECT picks one of seven (**cut · swap · delay · shuffle · reverse · repeat · pitch**) or MIXED to rotate through them, and **RATIO** says how often it fires, as one slice in N (1/2/3/4/6/8/12/16). Two earlier designs were wrong and are worth remembering: seven per-slice probability weights gave the same undifferentiated scatter at every setting, and replacing them with twelve named patterns welded the two questions together so most effects were stuck at one rate. The last slice of each group fires, so the effect lands on the approach to the downbeat. **It is zero-latency when it passes through**: a straight slice is read from the write head sample for sample, but you cannot reverse a slice you are still recording, so the transforms that need a finished one reach back a slot and work on THAT (reverse plays the previous slice backwards, pitch plays it slowed). **REPEAT stays live** — it plays the first 1/N as it arrives, then loops what it captured. It is also the only transform that splices *inside* a slice, so it is the only place a click can come from that the edge fades do not cover: the menu's **Repeat splice** is **Clean** (a 1.5ms raised cosine either side of the wrap, measured to cut the discontinuity from 5.9V to 2mV) or **Dirty** (leave it, because the click is most of what makes a stutter sound like a stutter rather than a loop). The splice fade is deliberately NOT the SHAPE curve: hiding a discontinuity inside a slice is a different job from shaping its edges, and it should not change character when the edge shape does. **WINDOW is how much of the slice is window**, expressed as a fade time: 5ms at the bottom, **half the slice** at the top, with the tooltip reading milliseconds rather than a percentage. It ran to a fixed 200ms ceiling until that ceiling turned out to be holding two different ideas apart. A fade is an *edge taper*, and the curve of an edge taper is nearly inaudible — the ear hears how long it is, not what shape it is. A window function is the *whole arc*, nought to one and back, and choosing between Hann and Gaussian only describes something real when the window spans the thing it is windowing. With the ceiling in place a 940ms slice at WINDOW maximum still kept a 540ms plateau, so the two half-curves never met: every setting was a Tukey window with a short taper, SHAPE only ever got to bend the taper, and five window functions were never allowed to be windows. That is why they all sounded the same. Clamped instead to half the slice, the top of the knob is a true window and the shapes separate completely — measured over a 940ms slice they run 19/29/36/42/55% of it above -20dB and 5.2dB apart in energy, where at a 48ms fade the same five sit within 0.004 of each other. WINDOW therefore sweeps from *declick* (SHAPE correctly irrelevant) to *grain envelope* (SHAPE decisive). Past half the slice the two fades would overlap and it would never reach full level, which is a volume drop rather than a window. It used to run from 1ms, which was wrong twice: a 1ms ramp is a quarter cycle at 261 Hz, so no curve is distinguishable from a hard edge down there — no curve was distinguishable from a hard edge, so the shape control had nothing to say at the bottom of its range — and the bottom of the knob was an unusable setting that looked like a legitimate one. There was briefly a longer floor for edges that gate to silence and a shorter one for edges that splice between two pieces of audio; the distinction is real, but 5ms serves both, so one number does it and there is no conditional left to get wrong. An edge with nothing to hide still gets no fade at all. **SHAPE picks the window, and there are only three of them.** The control was wrong three times, each one level deeper. Square returned 1.0 unconditionally, so one position of a *shape* control silently switched the whole envelope off — a hidden mode, not a shape, and it cost an afternoon of chasing a click that was a setting. Its replacement was *inaudible*: Gaussian(σ=0.4), Hann and smoothstep sat within 0.01 of each other. Respacing them by gain ratio did not help either, because a 27dB ratio between two silences is still silence — the honest metric is where a curve crosses into audibility, not how it compares with its neighbour. The actual mistake was a category error, and the fix is the WINDOW change above: a fade is an *edge taper* and the ear hears its length rather than its curvature, where a window function is the *whole arc* and its family name only describes something audible when the window spans the slice. Once they are genuinely windows, what separates them is **width, not pedigree**: Blackman, Hann, Sinc and Log are all wide smooth arcs, keeping 70/80/91/97% of the slice above -20dB, which is four names for one window. Gaussian stands apart only because its σ is narrowed to 0.22. So the set is three real widths and nothing that merely sounds like a fourth — **Gaussian** (47% of the slice loud, a blip in the middle of its slot), **Hann** (80%, the classic arc), **Log** (97%, nearly the whole slice with the corners taken off), a weakest gap of 17 points against 5.8 for the pair that was cut. Gaussian is shifted and rescaled so it truly reaches zero, since a Gaussian never does and starting at 0.044 is a step of 0.044; Log is a cubic attack, nearly immediate as a taper and near-rectangular as a window, and is the honest version of what Square was reached for. The screen header states the two fade lengths actually in force. DEPTH crossfades the altered slice against the straight one. **REACH is a COUNT, and the parameter itself is one** — 1..32, snapped, of steps or of bars once BAR is patched, with a `SliceReachQuantity` swapping the unit so the tooltip reads "8 steps" or "2 bars" rather than a percentage. One range and only the unit changing, because two ranges would leave three quarters of the travel dead in bar mode. As a percentage of thirty seconds the knob's whole lower half rounded to the same slice and no position on it named anything. Thirty-two bars at a slow tempo is still longer than the buffer, so the screen shows `7/32 bars` when the request is being capped rather than printing a reach that is not happening. **The screen is anchored to NOW**: the write head is the right-hand edge and the window is exactly REACH wide, with peaks read out of the buffer at whatever resolution that needs, the slice grid ticked along the foot, and a line back to where the current slice was fetched from. Drawing the whole buffer with a sweeping cursor showed where in an array you happened to be, which is a fact about the implementation. Under it, **one pane per channel, five seconds each, now at the right**, carrying both signals for that channel but drawn differently on purpose: **blue filled is what leaves the jack**, orange outline is what came in. Both were filled at first, and CUT at full depth then showed a fat orange waveform against complete silence — a display that draws a signal you cannot hear as though you can is worse than no display, so only the audible one is solid and the source it departed from is a line. The trace is the real output, post-DEPTH, not the pre-mix wet signal. Everything is drawn as a **filled envelope, the way Phase draws a sample** (peak along the top, back along the bottom, closed and filled); a column of separate bars reads as a bar chart rather than as a waveform. FREEZE stops the write head and loops. LINK (menu; it came off the panel to make room for WINDOW) pairs the channels (default) or gives the right its own source. The panel departs from the plugin's pot-over-jack pairs: **screen on top, controls in the middle, every jack in two rows of eight at the foot** with the outputs on a plate — Slice has twelve inputs and only five modulate a knob, so pairing would scatter the audio and clock jacks among the controls. Verified against the real table: all eight effects fire at all eight rates, exactly 48/n times in 48 slices.

34. **Sigma** (slug `Sigma`) — Additive voice after the Crumar
GDS (16/32/64 partials, 16 voices). Named for the summation sign: nothing here
generates a waveform or filters anything away, the output is a sum of sines and
every control is a statement about what enters that sum. (Called `Prism` until
2026-08 — the wrong metaphor, since a prism *splits* a beam where this
*assembles* one, and `Prism` is already a plugin brand in the VCV Library.) The
GDS gave each oscillator a 16-stage amplitude *and* frequency envelope plus two
velocity-interpolated envelope sets — 512 breakpoints per voice, which is why it
needed a $30,000 computer to program. The bet here is that the behaviour
survives **two numbers per partial**, envelope **depth** and **rate**, because
what makes a struck tone sound struck is that high partials die *sooner*, not
merely quieter. **Every macro is a curve across the partial index**: TILT spreads
level, STRETCH spreads pitch (`f_n = n·f0·√(1+B·n²)`), WIDTH spreads pan, ENV
SPREAD spreads envelope start time so the tone blooms upward or the highs speak
first and the fundamental builds underneath. Velocity **morphs between two
complete spectra** rather than scaling one. Screen is five tabs over one shared
spectrum (LEVEL/SOFT/PITCH/DEPTH/RATE) plus a bipolar 4×6 mod matrix (LFO1-3 +
ENV → level/pitch/pan/tilt/stretch/cutoff), a one-cycle scope and a pan block.
Fourteen context-menu presets, grouped by the mechanism each exercises rather
than by timbre — a preset is the cheapest way to find out whether a control
works, and Marimba is what exposed the PITCH tab spanning two cents.
**The clicking was the note-on, not the attack**: `g = V.mEnv` is the VCA and a
note-on zeroed it outright, so retriggering a still-sounding voice threw the
output to silence in one sample — measured at 0.55–0.94 of full scale on
thirteen of fourteen presets. The envelope now re-attacks from where it already
is. Second cause: the ENV RATE spread was multiplying the **attack** as well as
the decay, though it means "highs die sooner" — a 64-partial Gong's top partial
opened in 92 µs, far under one cycle of anything it was playing, and an envelope
segment shorter than a cycle is a step. The spread is now confined to decay and
release. Verify with `tools/sigma-envelope-harness.py`, which extracts
`advance()`, `loadPreset()` and the note-on block **verbatim** from sigma.cpp and
fails loudly rather than testing a stale copy. Spec in `docs/sigma-design.md`.

35. **Wheel** (slug `Wheel`) — Drone instrument after the
hurdy-gurdy (42HP; wheel + globals on the left, six voice columns on the right,
`VCVSlider` faders as in Sigma). `res/wheel.svg` is the **designer's Figma export** and carries its own outlined
labels, so the widget places components only — NO `sfs::PanelLabels`. Its guides
are colour-coded: **pink #FFDFDF = jack, blue #C3E8FE = trimpot, green #C3FED5 =
latch, grey stroked rect = VCVSlider**, and the colour is scaffolding that MUST
be stripped before shipping (`figma_panel.py strip`; `grid` reporting 0 guide
circles is how you know). Two traps beyond the skill's own list: **normalize is
every time, not once** — the header reverted to raw px the moment the designer
re-saved, and Rack then read the module as 853mm wide and screenshotted blank;
and **the art's labels sit 7.7mm ABOVE their control**, which geometry alone
cannot tell you (each row is also 6.3mm below the previous control) — what
settles it is that five label rows for five control rows only works one way
round. Read the other way, four of ten per-voice positions come out wrong. Each
voice is a **three-sub-column block** at 1HP spacing: latch on the centre, then
DEG/LEVEL faders, PHASE(DECAY)/PRESS and OCTAVE/WAVE trims, and DEG/LVL,
PHASE/PRESS, GATE/WAVE jacks.
Per-voice **degree CV is 1V PER DEGREE, not 1V/oct**: a degree offset stays in
the key, and moving a drone by a semitone is not something a hurdy-gurdy can do. Five drone voices, of which **voice 1 is locked
to the root**, plus a **trompette**. The identity is that **one rosined wheel bows every
string at once**, so nothing is independent of anything: the wheel is eccentric,
its rosin uneven, and it has a **seam** where it was joined, and every revolution
imposes the SAME ripple of level and brightness on every voice together. Five
oscillators with five LFOs sound like an organ; five sharing one slightly
irregular modulator sound like one object being played by one person.
Sawtooth-anchored polyBLEP oscillators rather than waveguides — Loom already owns
bowed strings here, and the character comes from the wheel. **Hurdy-gurdy rhythm
is counted in strokes per turn** ("quatre coups par tour"), so CRANK is the tempo,
COUPS the subdivision, and the pattern is a clickable ring of slots on the rim;
CLOCK locks one revolution per pulse. **The dog fires on stroke STRENGTH, not on
d(speed)/dt** — the acceleration threshold this was designed with measured
unusable three ways (60% of the DOG knob dead, the weak strokes never firing at
any setting, and cranking *faster* silencing the dog, because closely-spaced
strokes land on a speed envelope that has not come back down). **Per-stroke
accents are load-bearing**: with every stroke identical DOG can only be a mute
switch, and the ±9% jitter turns each crossing into a band where a stroke fires
*sometimes*, so DOG sweeps buzz density continuously. A coup also **swells every
drone**, which is half of why the accent lands. **Two amplitude faults, both found by measuring rather than by
listening harder**: RIPPLE was scaled to a 1.5 dB wobble at its default and 3.5
dB at maximum (a full range of travel with almost no consequence over it), and
the dog fired correctly but *could not be heard* — the buzz chopped the
trompette's amplitude, which is right, and then left it at its drone level, one
voice of six. RIPPLE now runs to a 25 dB swing and takes brightness with it (the
more audible half of what wheel grip varies); the buzz gets a +10 dB surge, a
`tanh` drive and a lower rattle so it reads as a brrap. **The per-voice input is
a GATE, not an envelope** — on the instrument there IS no envelope, the string is
against the wheel or it is not, and the onset shape belongs to the wheel: `SWELL`
(8ms–1.2s) is that shape. **The onset is a hand, not an exponential**: a one-pole
slew starts at its MAXIMUM velocity, which is the one thing a hand cannot do, so
the contour is a minimum-jerk profile (Flash & Hogan 1985, `10t³−15t⁴+6t⁵`,
measured opening velocity 0.0000/sample against a one-pole's 0.0026), it
**overshoots and settles only when it moves fast** (+17.6% at an 8ms press,
+4.9% at 200ms — overshoot is mass, not intent, and it is the bite at the start
of the note), it is scaled to the distance moved, and it jitters ±12% so no two
presses are alike. Two contours, because they are two acts: the GATE is a hand
pressing (SWELL long, overshoots), the LATCH is shimming a string off the wheel
(discrete, 25ms, no overshoot) — folded into one, a slow gate made lifting a
string take a second. **The LED follows the LATCH, not the gate**, so a gated-off
string keeps its panel LED lit and goes dark only on the screen. **No per-voice 1V/oct**: the degree offset is the
authentic control, and ROOT/SCALE move all six together as a key change does.
**TEMPER** snaps the voices to just ratios — and it *looks* broken on a traditional voicing without being so: 12-TET is already within 2 cents of just at the fifth and exact at the octave, so on a drone setup of roots, octaves and fifths (which is what a hurdy-gurdy IS) only a third or sixth moves at all (±14–16 cents; measured, harness mode 6), and the readout therefore states what TEMPER is DOING (`JUST 14c` / `JUST 0c` / `EQUAL` / `SCALE`) rather than what it is set to. Beatless, as the instrument is tuned by ear, and it is also what
makes PHASE hold still (a 12-TET fifth is 1.4983, so relative phase rotates about
once a second and a static offset is inaudible); it goes **inert on a non-12-TET
scale**, as Key's free-sub-scale option does. SCALE reads **Key's polyphonic
scale bus**, so DEGREE wraps rather than clamps and OCT adds the *period* rather
than 12 semitones. Three ways to quieten a voice doing three different jobs:
LEVEL is the mix, **PRESS** is how hard that string sits on the wheel (timbre
before level — a barely-touching string slips and gives rosin instead of tone),
and **ON** is lifting it off, which is discrete because shimming a string is. The
per-voice **ENV drives PRESS**, not a VCA, because pressing a string onto a wheel
gives attack timbre. Display is a **literal perspective render** drawn on the faceplate with **no
screen** (which inverts the palette: the display blue is built to glow out of
#1a1a32 and vanishes on #f0f0f0, so it is the panel's greys with orange for a
buzz). **THE WHEEL'S PLANE IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE STRINGS and its axle is
PARALLEL to them** — the axle is the crank shaft up the instrument's long axis.
Not a stylistic point: bowing needs the contact surface to move ACROSS the
string, the rim's velocity lies in the wheel's plane, so a wheel turning in the
strings' own plane would rub ALONG them and never speak. Two earlier renders had
exactly that (a hamster wheel) and looked plausible. **Only the visible 117° arc
is drawn**, emerging through a slot in the soundboard — the rest of the wheel is
inside the body, and drawing the whole disc spent the picture's height on a part
nobody can see. It is a **solid** (tread band, filled near face, slot lip stroked
back over it), not a wireframe: a wireframe read as a cage, and with the far half
faded as a spiky mass. Strings are **parallel** (perspective spreads the near end
1.8x over the far one — no fan needed) and **not evenly spaced** (outer gaps
3.3x the inner, as on the instrument; an even comb is the one thing that
immediately looks synthetic). **Up is lifted and a lifted string stays visible**
at 0.42 alpha — drawing it as nearly-nothing says "gone" when it means "off the
wheel". Reading a viewpoint off a drawing needs two things and neither is the
transform: a circle only tells you its viewing angle by how much it is SQUASHED
(a 0.85-aspect ellipse read as seen-from-below however correct the maths), and
depth has to actually be DRAWN (a flat-coloured rim with the ramp clamped said
nothing about which side was nearer). The stroke pattern is a static unwrapped
strip, not marks on the rim (marks that turn with the wheel are moving click
targets), and **the strip IS the coup mechanism drawn**: bar height = that
stroke's strength from its metric position, dashed line across = the DOG
threshold, whisker = the stroke jitter, stub = a muted slot. It was a row of
identical ticks, which is why the mechanism read as arbitrary — TWO things take
strokes away (the pattern, and DOG thinning it by accent) and the strip showed
neither. Cranking faster grows every bar, so the technique is visible too.
Verify with `tools/wheel-dog-harness.py`, which extracts the crank/coup/dog block
and `rippleAt()` **verbatim** from wheel.cpp and fails loudly rather than testing
a stale copy. Spec in `docs/wheel-design.md`.

36. **Kit** (slug `Kit`) — Struck membrane, modelled mode by mode (22HP). A drum head is a 2D wave equation on a disc and its solutions are the Bessel modes `J_m(j_mn·r/R)·cos(mθ)`, so rather than run a mesh, `src/membrane.hpp` runs **one resonator per mode** — cheaper, and it puts every playable parameter in plain sight: strike position is a per-mode gain evaluated in closed form, and MUFFLE is the same evaluation used subtractively. **The one thing to know about the parameters:** for an ideal membrane `f = (c/2πR)·j_mn` with `c = √(T/σ)`, so radius and tension scale every mode by the same factor and leave the RATIOS untouched — SIZE and TENSION are acoustically one control, and shipping both would be shipping a duplicate. What breaks the scale invariance, and so what makes a small tight drum differ from a large slack one at the same pitch, is **bending stiffness (MATERIAL), the air cavity (AIR) and size-dependent damping**. Those are the reason SIZE is allowed to exist. AIR closes the BOTTOM rather than following the shell: at zero it is an open shell with a resonant head across it (tom, kick), wound up it bellies into a sealed bowl (kettledrum) — which is exactly what the harmonic series AIR imposes belongs to. Tooltips report **quantities, not percentages** (SIZE in inches and cm, EXCITER as "hard mallet, 3.4 ms contact", DECAY reading SIZE because it depends on it). **EIGHT INSTRUMENTS, ONE PANEL** (2026-09): `Kit::Inst inst[KIT_N]` each holds its own `sfs::Drum`, its own copy of every knob value (`v[PARAMS_LEN]`) and its own mic pair; the panel's knobs are a VIEW onto `inst[edit]`, pushed on a tab click (`editReq`, consumed in `process()` so knobs and slot switch together) and copied back every sample, so there is no change detection to get wrong. **Channel N of every cable is instrument N**: a poly GATE fires N from channel N (a MONO gate fires instrument 1 only, since one trigger firing eight drums is never what a mono cable means), and every other input reads `getPolyVoltage(N)` so a mono cable modulates all eight. **One poly OUT**: sixteen channels, instrument N on 2N/2N+1, which is exactly a cable, plus a stereo MIX pair on the old HEAD/WIRES ids (retained; outputs serialise by index) -- head and wires are summed per instrument. Pre-2026-09 patches load as instrument 1 with no migration: params were already restored, a mono gate still fires it, channel 0 is still its left, and the old L/R-on-0/1 stereo convention is instrument 1's pair. **Quiet drums cost nothing**: a drum whose energy has decayed out (below 2e-8 in the follower's units, after a 0.25 s hold past the strike so the mallet's pre-contact gap is not mistaken for silence) skips its mode bank, and the control-rate updates are staggered four samples apart. The screen's eight **tabs are the instruments drawn**: `drawHead3D` is parametrised by centre, radius and detail (12x36 for the main view, 8x24 for a tab) and the display's `S` pointer says which instrument is being drawn, so a struck instrument's tab rings while the main view keeps showing the one being edited; a level bar under each tab, on one baseline, is the kit's balance. `tools/kit-stereo-harness.py` extracts `struct Inst`, `pvc()`, `xin()`, `control(int)` and the strike line verbatim and still passes all three modes. **PolyKit In** (slug `PolyKitIn`, 33HP) is the expander to Kit's LEFT: thirteen columns (Kit's thirteen inputs) by eight rows (the instruments), every cell a mono jack, sent over `PolyKitMessage` each sample. In Kit every per-instrument read goes through `xin(in, c, v)`: the expander's jack wins WHEN PATCHED, per jack, otherwise channel c of Kit's own poly cable, so a poly trigger from Fill and one hand-patched tension can coexist. The art's artboard is 32.54HP and was snapped to 33 on normalize. **STEREO** (menu, off by default) makes all three outs 2-channel polyphonic — L on 0, R on 1 — by tapping the head at **two points instead of one**. It is the first thing in Kit that makes the strike ANGLE audible: a disc is rotationally symmetric, so with one listening point only the radius is a tone control, and a second point breaks the symmetry. Mode k reads `J_m(j_mn·r_mic)·cos(m·(θ_mic − θ_strike))` — the same closed form the strike and the muffle already use. **Both mics sit at the same radius**, because an m = 0 mode is a **monopole**: no angular shape, so it reads identically at every point on the head and no placement can decorrelate it. Different radii therefore do not separate the monopoles, they only make one channel permanently 2.8 dB louder. And the monopoles are most of the sound — measured across the ten instruments, **69–93% of the energy is at m = 0**, which is worth about −12 dB of side with the fundamental dead centre. Honest (a drum's low thump IS mono in a real pair), but not an image. The image comes from putting the mics **in the air rather than on the skin**: each is at a different distance from the strike, so it gets its own arrival time and its own 1/r level, and on a struck instrument that transient cue is most of what the ear localises with. The drum therefore **moves when you move the strike** — measured at ±5.5 dB corner to corner — which no panner could fake. This is also the one place a drum's **absolute** size matters (everything else here is scale-invariant, which is the whole argument for SIZE and TENSION being one control): the speed of sound is not a ratio, so a 22-inch kick images far wider than a 6-inch splash. Three numbers are tuned by measurement, not taste (`tools/kit-stereo-harness.py`): the pair is **150° apart** (width flattens out past that) with its centre line **30° off the default strike**, because two points on a disc always have a perpendicular bisector and a strike along it is equidistant AND angularly symmetric — there are always two directions where the drum is dead centre, and that must not be where every instrument ships pointing; and the mics sit **0.7 radii up**, which is the level half of the image and almost none of the width. Level is matched to mono by **energy, not by the first sample** — the taps redistribute the strike across modes that ring for very different lengths, so an impulse match left the frame drum 7.9 dB loud. **The mics are dragged on the head**, not set from knobs — the panel has no free control, and more to the point how a pair sounds is a fact about where it is *relative to the strike*, which is the thing the screen is already showing. A press on a mark grabs it (tested before the strike, since the head is a play surface everywhere), the bottom line reads that mic's radius and angle while you hold it, and travel stops short of both the rim (every mode is nodal there) and dead centre (only monopoles exist there, so a mic in the middle is a mono mic wherever the other one is). Positions are saved with the patch; "Reset mic positions" restores the measured pair. Verified by `tools/kit-stereo-harness.py mouse`, which extracts the projection and the hit-test **verbatim** and requires the screen↔head round trip to be exact in both the flat and 3D views — this widget already inverted the flat projection once while the 3D view was showing. Delay and level latch at the **strike** and cross-fade over 2 ms; the mono path is **bit-identical** to what it was before stereo existed (harness mode `identity` puts both mics at the strike point and requires the stereo path to collapse exactly onto the mono one), and the two snare-wire sets run separate noise streams, since twenty strands are not one source. Mono sum loss is under 1.1 dB on every preset. The screen draws the head as it moves and you strike it with the mouse; TENSION redistributes the grid (taut pulls rings toward the rim), and the snare wires are **straight solid lines that buzz on strike** — a coil is the more accurate drawing and at this size it read as a braid round the shell, so the accurate one was the wrong one. **The default kit is Fill's eight channels in Fill's order** (KICK SNR CHH OHH LOW HIGH CLAP BELL; Closed hat, Open hat, Clap and Bell are presets added for it), so a poly cable from Fill plays the right drum on every channel; a right-click on a tab is that tab's own menu. Stereo pairs default ON now that the poly out always carries L/R. Ten of the fourteen instruments in the menu are the ones the engine was measured against, so they are also the fastest way to hear whether a change broke something. **V/OCT reference** (per instrument, `Inst::voctC4`, saved, off by default): off, 0 V is the drum as SIZE/TENSION tune it (the default kit spans 48 Hz kick to 309 Hz hats); on, 0 V = `dsp::FREQ_C4`, SIZE drops out of the pitch (keeps radius, decay, image) and TENSION is a ±fifth fine tune exact at centre. Only while that instrument's V/OCT is fed, so an unpatched jack cannot pull the kit to C4. **A retrigger adds to a ringing head**: `strike()` re-arms the mallet and re-latches the mic delays and never clears the mode bank, so a new hit meets a displaced head and two close hits can sum louder than one; no choke groups yet. **THE HI-HAT IS A SECOND ENGINE** (2026-09): `Inst::engine` is `HEAD` (`sfs::Drum`) or `HAT` (`sfs::Hat`, `src/kit-hat.hpp`), per instrument and saved; no "engine" key = a pre-hat patch, loaded as all membranes so it sounds as saved. The hat is round Q1 of `tools/hat-plate-harness.cpp` (two modal plates colliding at 8 points round a tilted rim, a statistical energy field above 5 kHz, loss that grows with amplitude; design and the seven listening rounds in `docs/kit-hat-design.md`), ported to flat arrays so the mode loops vectorise: 0.4 us/sample per ringing hat against the harness's 3.1. `Inst::useHat()` builds and calibrates it (~15 ms, it runs the model) BEFORE `engine` flips, so the audio thread never sees half a hat; it is rebuilt on a sample-rate change. **PEDAL_PARAM (appended) took HIT's place on the panel** — `STRIKE_PARAM` is retired in place, clicking the head strikes — and the art's HIT label was rebuilt as PEDAL from the art's own outlined glyphs (P from POLY OUT, D E A from DECAY, L from LEVEL). The Closed hat and Open hat presets are the hat engine, the same 14" pair differing only in PEDAL (`KitPreset` gained `engine, pedal`). Knobs on a hat: SIZE diameter (modes ∝ 1/D²), TENSION/V/OCT pitch, DECAY the clutch (max ring time), TONE brightness, EXCITER/WEIGHT the stick, MUFFLE a hand on the top plate, STRIKE X/Y bow or edge; AIR/COUPLE/RESO/BEND/wires ignored. The screen draws two plates on a rod (`drawHat3D`, top bell up, bottom bell down and tilted, gap from the engine's slewed pedal) in both views and on the tab; the mics are fixed and not drawn. Checks: `tools/kit-hat-check.cpp` (engine vs the Q1 reference on every measurement), the membrane harnesses skip hat presets, and every membrane preset renders identically to before the hat existed. **Clap and Bell are still PROVISIONAL and known bad** (`tools/kit-voice-harness.py`): the mono pickup's double 1/ω tilt buries a plate's partials, nothing makes the clap's 3–4 bursts, and the bell's f0 tops out near 600 Hz with cowbell ratios. The fix is engine work, not presets — Stage 1 keyed to MATERIAL so every membrane stays bit-identical (contact stiffness includes the struck surface, output tilt follows MATERIAL, DECAY's stiffness multiplier raises the ceiling not the floor), Stage 2 per-instrument voice properties (strike count/spacing with jitter, noise band, octave) — and is waiting on a go. Mode table = zeros of `J_m` by bisection, reproducing 1, 1.594, 2.136, 2.296… to three decimals (the first generator scanned up from zero and "found" roots at x = 0.00002, because `J_m(0) = 0` for m ≥ 1 and rounding noise flips the sign there; `J_m` has no zeros below x = m)
37. **Trace** (slug `Trace`) — A paper loop and four brushes (34HP): draw four CVs, or let the patch draw them. Part Oramics, part chart recorder — the latter is why the read offsets are **per lane** rather than global. **Two things carry it, and neither is "a curve editor".** (1) **The transport is uncoupled from the brush.** Every draw-a-shape module is a static editor: you see the whole loop, edit it as an object, and playback is a cursor sweeping your artwork. Here the paper moves whether you are drawing or not, which makes it an instrument — and gives three behaviours for free, decided by nothing but where the mouse is: left of NOW you edit what just played, right of it you compose the future with lead time, on it you perform. (2) **Ink is a second dimension**: the brush lays down weight as well as position, so each lane carries two signals; ink accumulates over passes and pools where the line sits still, which makes the thickness track "how settled is this line" — sustains heavy, transitions light — with nobody drawing it. Events come from the **shape, not the value**: each lane classifies its slope as up/down/flat and fires on the transitions, so a scribble makes notes where it turns around and no quantization is involved. The paper is a **length, not a duration** — LENGTH sets how many cells go round, SPEED how fast they pass, so speeding up shortens the loop rather than compressing what is on it. **The brush cannot be down while the paper runs backwards**, stated as a state rule rather than "a direction change lifts the brush" because the state version already answers what happens if you press the mouse while reversed (nothing is written) where an edge rule has to answer that separately and gets it wrong: a brush writing onto paper moving the other way retraces over what it just laid down and the stroke eats itself. Per lane: range, smooth/stepped read, quantize, and **copy to another lane** — copying a shape then offsetting the heads is how you get phase-shifted reads of one gesture, so it is load-bearing. `WRITE_INPUT` and `WRITE_PARAM` are **retired in place**.

38. **OP MORPH** (slug `OpMorph`) — Expander for Operator (12HP): the DX7 routing as a matrix, and a field of them you travel across. Place it to the **right** of Operator. A DX7 algorithm is a stack machine over three buses, which is a fast way to evaluate something simpler — a table of "how much of operator i is added to operator j's PHASE" plus "how much of i reaches the output". All 32 evaluate in operator order 0→5 with every modulator strictly before what it modulates, so the table is **strictly upper triangular**: 15 modulation weights, 6 output weights (`src/msfa/fm_matrix.cc`, `w[6][7]` is `[src][dst]`). **The two column groups are both VCAs and feel nothing alike**: columns 0..5 feed a PHASE input so they are FM *index* (turning one up grows sidebands, it does not get louder), column 6 feeds the output bus and is a plain *level*. An operator with both modulates its neighbour AND is audible in its own right, which no DX7 algorithm does. **The field is a TORUS, not a square**: 16 slots on a 4×4 grid, X/Y bilinearly blending the four nearest, both axes wrapping — on a square, x=0 and x=1 hold different routings so wrapping past the edge jumps between two structures mid-note, a routing discontinuity, which is a click. **Only 11 of the 15 possible modulation edges appear in the 32 algorithms**; (0,4) (0,5) (1,4) (2,4) are structures Yamaha never shipped and no blend can reach them, because a blend only produces edges one of its endpoints already has — they are reachable by editing a slot's matrix. STEP does not replace the movement, it **quantizes** it: the path keeps running underneath and the clock snaps the output to the nearest slot, so whatever the turtle is drawing arrives on the beat (Linear is the exception — there a clock means one slot forward). Screen carries the Sigma matrix style (a ruled lattice, a dot riding a centreline rather than a bar with area) plus row/column names, because the OUT column's colour could not say what it meant
39. **Spool** (slug `Spool`) — Four short tapes, one transport, and no rewind (22HP). After the Mellotron and departing from it in the one place that matters: the tape is NOT sprung back when the gate falls, it stays where it stopped and the next note carries on from there, so a repeated stab walks through the loop. `REWIND_PARAM` ("New note starts": where the tape stopped / at the beginning) offers the authentic behaviour rather than imposing it. Four tapes A–D, five seconds each (`SP_MAXSEC`), loaded from WAV (summed to mono, resampled, capped) or RECORDED from a per-tape jack; **recordings are written into the patch storage directory** as 16-bit mono WAV (`tapeFile()`/`writeTape()`), because a path is not enough for audio that has no file behind it. **Eight heads per tape** (`SP_POLY`): a poly GATE is one head per channel and each head reads at the V/OCT of its own channel, sampled at note-on and followed while gated (`hd.voct`); the free head or the QUIETEST is taken. **The bookmark (`t.pos`) is dragged by the newest gated head only** and stops where that head was when its gate fell — what stops the tape is the gate, what stops the SOUND is the envelope, and a lap ends where it began. There was a full-pass rule ("a play always completes one lap") and it was wrong twice: it made every play a five-second lap and killed the offset between successive plays. **Pitch is varispeed**: V/OCT scales the read rate so pitch and period move together; ABS (`PMODE_PARAM`) measures the tape's pitch (`sfs::PitchTracker`, once at load by default — `DETECT_PARAM`, continuous tracking updated at 5 Hz and sampled vibrato at arbitrary phase) and retunes to the note relative to ROOT (the plugin's 12-note root). **`STRETCH_PARAM` (menu, "V/OCT changes: Pitch only") time-stretches instead**: the transport runs at 1x (ramp, sag and wow still on it) and `shiftRead()` moves the pitch on the way off the tape with two sweeping taps, clamped to two octaves either way. What makes it not warble is that on a pitched tape the taps are kept **a whole number of the tape's detected periods apart** (window 2kP, k the smallest giving ≥ 20 ms), so the handover crossfades two copies of one waveform at one phase — Lent's method, the pitch-synchronous half of PSOLA, as a sweep; measured in `tools/spool-stretch-harness.cpp` at the same level ripple as varispeed where a fixed 50 ms window ran 3–5× that. Unpitched tapes get a window **dithered 30–70 ms at every handover**, because two taps a fixed distance apart on one tape are a delayed copy of each other and that is a comb (flatness 0.77 at +1 oct, 0.99 dithered), and an equal-power fade rather than Hann. The window is only ever resized when a tap is silent (A carries the transport at phase 0.5, B at A's wrap), and within five cents of unity the pair walks to a single tap so a stopped sweep is not a comb. **One transport**: ATTACK/RELEASE (`LpTimeQuantity`, exponential, read as times; release default 290 ms because at 32 ms a retriggered mono gate never had two heads sounding and the module looked monophonic), RAMP (a rate ramp 0–60 ms, not a fade: the capstan getting up to speed, and what stops a resumed tape clicking), SAT, and WOW/FLUTTER shared because they are the motor (wow is two slow components — one sine is a vibrato). Each of A/R/RAMP has a CV input (`ATTACK_CV_INPUT`, `RELEASE_CV_INPUT`, `RAMP_CV_INPUT`, ±5 V full range, clamped BEFORE `knobTime()` because it is exponential and 1.5 on RELEASE is 90 s). Motor SAG (menu slider) flattens a chord by head count. **Density is normalised by the SUMMED ENVELOPES** of sounding heads, not by head count, which stepped. Mix pans A left to D right. Display: four lanes in the panel's own lane colours (`laneColour()`, read from `res/spool.svg`), white head marks (tape C's colour IS `SCREEN_HOT`), dim bookmark always drawn, letter + name, detected pitch as note and Hz. Panel is the designer's Figma export (`design/figma/spool-panel.svg`, no `sfs::PanelLabels`); layout constants `SP_SUB/SP_GLOB/SP_FOOT`. Renamed from Loop in 2026-09.
40. **Field** (slug `Field`) — Nineteen random voltages that are one thing (16HP). Nineteen jacks on a pointy-top hex grid (centre, ring of 6, ring of 12; `FD_JX/FD_JY` in mm, `FD_GX/FD_GY` in grid units, `FD_R` the ring radius) each reading ONE smooth random field (`FieldNoise`: 3D value noise, quintic fade, two octaves; value rather than gradient noise because its lattice period is exactly 1, so at one period per jack pitch neighbours are uncorrelated and that is the honest bottom of COHERENCE). **COHERENCE is measured, not guessed**: `k = 0.6·(0.05/0.6)^coh` was fitted by neighbour correlation across the grid, because the first range left the lower half of the knob dead. FLOW (0–4 jacks/s) and DIR (0–360°) always mean speed and direction; what they move is the ANIMATION (`enum FieldAnim`, snap knob + 1 V/mode `ANIM_INPUT`): Flow (window), Zoom (two-octave crossfade so it never runs out of detail), Spin, Random (per-jack windows), and then simulations on the cell graph (`fieldCells()`: 271 flat-top hex cells with six neighbours, `FD_SUB=4` subdivisions filling a `FD_PLATE_R=34.6` mm hex plate, `fieldJackCell()` maps a jack to its cell so **the outputs read the picture**): **Life** B2/S345 + 0.003 trickle (B2/S34 froze or died), **Rain/Wave** one leapfrog wave equation (c² 0.9, 200 steps/Hz, ≤6 per tick, **mean removed every step** — without it the surface drifted to 814 and saturated), rain drops vs crests from the edge facing DIR, coherence = damping inverted; **React** Gray–Scott (Du 0.25, Dv 0.125) along a measured feed/kill path `PF/PK` (coverage and blob count, not taste — the linear path saturated); **Cyclic** rock-paper-scissors with N = 4 + round(coh·4) states (capped at 8); **Sand** BTW sandpile, threshold 6; **Worley** 3–16 drifting seeds. BIAS tilts amplitude by `FD_R`; SMOOTH slews 0–2 s; TRIG makes it a S&H bank (poly: channel N holds jack N; mono holds all). RATE `fieldRateHz(r) = 0.002·10000^r` (eight minutes to 20 Hz; the bottom was raised after "rate zero could be much slower"). **No screen: the plate IS the display**, tiled cells clipped to the flat hex (`clipToFlatHex`) and drawn in the PANEL layer under the jacks — a light-layer draw came back on top of them, and painting outside the hex covered the art's labels. Palettes `FIELD_PALETTES[]` + Rainbow (`fieldColour`), menu only, saved with the patch. POLY out carries jacks 1–16. Panel is the designer's Figma export (`design/figma/field-panel.svg`, no `sfs::PanelLabels`); layout `FD_TX/FD_CVX/FD_FX` and rows `FD_Y_TRIM/FD_Y_CV/FD_Y_FOOT/FD_Y_POLY`.
41. **Flock** (slug `Flock`) — A murmuration as a microtonal granular voice (18HP). Up to 1024 persistent birds under Boids rules with seven topological neighbours (Ballerini), an arrive rule and velocity-matching alignment, in a unit cube of offsets round the roost; height × LATITUDE is pitch, and every call is a grain (cost is voices, `FL_MAXGRAINS` 64, not birds). LAG is each bird's slewed copy of the roost (`heard`), so a new pitch propagates through the flock. STRUCTURE = Gaussian wells at just ratios, QUANT snaps calls toward `FL_GRIDS`, VARIETY = per-bird voices and syllables. The listener pair stands `FL_LISTEN_D` = 0.5 from the roost, turns its head to the centroid, and pans each call by its **wrapped bearing divided by the flock's settled angular spread** (`spreadRef`, slewed 2 s, **held while the hawk is in the flock** or the startle normalises itself away); WIDTH tiers {0.8, 1.3, 2.2}. **Lead bird calls on the gate** (menu, default on): `bird[0]` calls unconditionally at the gate edge, because the gate is flight and calls are Poisson, so one bird had a random onset and three gates in four silent. Screenless display in Wheel's greys: perspective, the near face of the box not drawn (found by depth each frame), the floor's front edge always drawn, **drag to orbit the camera** (`camYaw`/`camTilt`, saved), double-click resets. Panel is the designer's Figma export (no `sfs::PanelLabels`); row B is in the ART's order (LENGTH RELEASE CHIRP VARIETY RATE QUANT); PITCH/DENS/HAWK outputs retired in place. `tools/flock-harness.cpp` compiles the module against libRack and measures cohesion, propagation, startle, stereo width, per-call pan, one-bird onset and cost. Design and every listening round in `docs/flock-design.md`.
42. **Flock In** (slug `FlockIn`) — 4HP expander to Flock's LEFT: stereo in (R normalled from L), ENV (grain peak position, 5–95%), REACH (50 ms–10 s, `fiReachSec`), FREEZE latch + gate, each with CV. A dumb sender: one `FlockInMessage` per sample (`src/flock-messages.hpp`); the 2^19-frame ring lives in Flock, and a sampled call reads it at `exp2((pitch − 12·octave)/12)` with its depth in the flock as the read offset. Designer's Figma export, no runtime labels.
43. **Canon** (slug `Canon`, called Round until 2026-09-21, hidden, first pass 2026-09) — Four arpeggiators reading one progression (26HP), Fugue's relative for chords. Four **sets** (`CanonSet`, up to six `CanonNote`s each stored as a **scale degree** or, when chosen off the scale, a free semitone from the root, exactly Key's sub-scale rule) shared by four **channels**; SET gate advances past empty sets, SET CV (1V/set) wins when patched, LEARN writes a held poly V/OCT into the current set (dedup by pitch class). Per channel GATE in (**normalled left to right**, a cable breaks the chain), PATTERN (snap, 8 families × 1/2 octaves: up, down, up-down, converge, diverge, pedal, random, as-played; `buildSequence()` verified against a hand table), WANDER (`wanderPick()`: stay 1−w, else chord tone 45% / extension 30% / colour 15% / rest 10%, rest only if `wanderRest`), OCTAVE (snap ±2), a per-channel **step offset** (menu, 0–11, `Ch::offset`, applied to where the channel reads and not where it counts, so offsets 0 1 2 3 on one clock play the chord as a block), a **V/OCT + GATE pair out, no poly** (user: poly is annoying to patch). **Harmonic lock** = Fugue's, across channels: three candidates, the most consonant with what the others sound wins (measured +0.19 mean pairwise consonance at WANDER 60%). **A channel keeps its index through a set change** (menu `restartOnSet` for the strict reading). `src/harmonic-tiers.hpp` is Fugue's tier tables and `intervalConsonance()` moved verbatim so the two cannot drift. Screen: four keyboards, the set in force framed, a marker per channel that STAYS on its last note (drawn only while gated they blinked with the clock) in the plugin's four channel colours `CN_CH_COL` (blue/green/orange/purple, as Trace and Spool), click a key to toggle a note, right-click a keyboard for THAT set's menu (play now, voicings via `applyVoicing()`, copy from the playing set, clear); **twenty chord progressions** in the menu (`progressions()`: degree-built triads/sevenths, three semitone-stated borrowed-chord ones, three minor ones that set SCALE to Natural minor); `canonPreview()` warms a real instance. Panel is the **designer's Figma export** (2026-09-21; no `sfs::PanelLabels`, in `FINISHED`); the set in force is `nextCount + SETSEL_PARAM + SET CV` mod 4 (`resolveSet()`), so NEXT, the SET knob (appended) and the CV compose; the foot plate is GATE then V/OCT. `tools/canon-harness.cpp` checks patterns, set-change continuity, the lock margin, wander bounds, LEARN and gate normalling.
44. **Count** (slug `Count`, called Sieve until 2026-09-21, hidden, first pass 2026-09) — A narrow clock (8HP, the designer's Figma export, no `sfs::PanelLabels`, in `FINISHED`): BPM and STEPS (1–32) with CVs, CLOCK in at one pulse per beat (measured between edges, and **every edge lands `phase` exactly on its beat**, held back from the next beat until the pulse arrives) and RESET. Six outputs, each **DIV** (snapped `CT_DIVS`, /64..x64 including the odd 1.5, 3 and 5 each way, `CT_UNITY` = x1 in the middle) and **MASK** (`CtMask`, fifteen in knob order: all, odd, even, pairs xxoo, threes xxxo, fours xxxxoooo, front half, back half, Euclid 1/3, 7/16, 5/8, burst out, burst in, downbeat, none last as a mute; `ctBurst()` = runs of R..1 with single rests, R the largest that fits). **Each output counts its OWN pulses modulo STEPS** (`floor(phase × rate)`), so a x2 output runs the cycle at twice the speed; the Euclidean masks take their density from STEPS as a ratio (Bresenham `(i·k) mod n < k`, always hits step 0), which is why there is no second selector; **rotate each cycle** (`Out::rotStep`, cumulative: `rotNow = rot + rotStep × cycles`, the meaning the user expected of "rotate"), a fixed **offset** (`Out::rot`, whose menu shows the resulting row because a repeating mask offset by its period is a no-op) and gate length (5 ms trigger / half the pulse) are menu items. The strip is 15 mm: tempo and steps, then a row of dots per output. `tools/count-harness.cpp` checks every mask row, pulses per beat per DIV, the cycle length at x4, rotation, and external-clock lock. Design in `docs/count-design.md`.
45. **Peal** (slug `Peal`, hidden, first pass 2026-09-22) — A grid of bells joined by rods (26HP, screenless, drawn on the faceplate from a foreshortened angle like Wheel and Flock). 25 modal bells (`PL_MODES` 11: hum/prime/tierce/quint/nominal/deciem/duodeciem/double octave with **doublet twins a few cents off on prime, tierce and nominal** for the beating that reads as a bell, plus a bandpassed **clapper** noise burst; **SHAPE** (appended) morphs the partial set geometrically toward a free bar's (`PL_BAR_*`: 1, 2.76, 5.40, 8.93…, short decays), **BRIGHT** (appended) is mallet hardness plus a partial tilt; excited by a **mallet contact**, a raised-cosine force over 0.1–6 ms scaled by size, BRIGHT and SHAPE (a Hann contact of T strikes nothing above 2/T, and 1.5 ms at C4 was the muffle), NOT a one-sample impulse, which read as a switch; every voice carries a **radiation tilt** of √ratio because the tables are displacement amplitudes; T60 up to 14 s for the hum and DAMP = 1 + 40·k² with a 0.12 default, because the first table and a ×8.5 default damping made a plink; complex one-pole resonators; smaller bells decay faster) on a 5×5 grid; layouts `PL_LAYOUTS` (Tonnetz fifths-across/thirds-down default, chromatic, whole-tone), folded into two octaves round ROOT. **ROOT/SCALE do not retune, they FELT**: an out-of-key bell is struck at 0.2 amplitude, decays 8× faster, and still conducts (`unmask` lifts the felts). **Rods** join ANY two bells (`rodM[25×25]` symmetric, `hasRod/setRod/degree`, saved as pairs; free-running crossing time × `pealDist`, clocked one pulse regardless) and carry energy as scheduled events: each arrival sends `energy × 0.85 / degree` down every rod, which is **conserved so a mesh cannot multiply energy** (0.55 reached six bells at any velocity; 0.85/deg reaches 3/6/8/10 at 1/2.5/5/10 V with the cubic velocity curve `vel³ × 4`), and nothing below `pealFloor(REACH)` passes. A rod excites the receiver's partials the SENDER shares (Gaussian in cents, floor 0.15), so a fifth away answers 3.6× louder than a semitone away. **SPEED** is the crossing time free-running (4 s to 10 ms, clockwise faster, 360 ms default); **with CLOCK patched every pending crossing lands on the NEXT pulse** (`Event::pulseAt` vs `pulseCount`, so a gate on the pulse's own sample waits a full period; measured: 250 ms gaps at 4 Hz whatever SPEED says), so the grid is a sequencer. Two draggable **mics** on the grid plane (per-bell delay lines and 1/distance gain; swapping the pair flips a left bell's balance from −0.32 to +0.32), POLY out = the 16 loudest bells, each keeping its channel while it rings. `PealView` is the plane projection with a closed-form inverse, and the hit-test is it run backwards (round-trip exact on all 25). Drag from a bell and release on any other to lay or lift a rod (the rod in progress is drawn to the pointer); hovering a bell names its note and octave; click strikes (height = velocity), drag a mic moves it; bells are drawn as bells hanging from their crowns and swing when struck; impulses in flight draw as ant trails along their rods; menu: layout, lift the felts, rod presets (mesh, rows, columns, spiral, chain, clear), reset mics. 25 bells on a full mesh cost 0.95% of a core. `tools/peal-harness.cpp` checks all of it. Design in `docs/peal-design.md`.

### Module Development Pattern
Each module follows the VCV Rack module pattern:
- Inherits from `Module` class
- Defines `ParamId`, `InputId`, `OutputId`, and `LightId` enums
- Implements `process()` method for audio processing
- Has corresponding widget class for UI

### Launch Checklist
**Before a module goes from hidden to shipping, and before any release is
tagged, work through `docs/conventions/launch-checklist.md`.** Every item on it
was learned by getting it wrong once. It covers the panel, the browser preview,
metadata (a tag the Library does not recognise is rejected *after* you tag the
release), documentation, and the release steps.

**Static analysis is part of it, at release time.** The VCV Library runs
**cppcheck AND clang-tidy** on every submission and opens an issue with what it finds, so run it
before they do — when preparing a release, **not** on every dev build:

```bash
./tools/static-check.sh  # cppcheck + clang-tidy; exit status = findings
```

The first such report contained two real bugs that no amount of playing the
modules would have surfaced: Fill importing a bank with an uninitialised taste
struct, and a lookup table read one element past its end at a phase of exactly
1.0. Fix the *declaration* as well as the call site, and silence a false
positive rather than living with it — a checker that cries wolf on every
submission is how a real finding gets missed.

### Panel Conventions
**NEVER add virtual screws to a panel.** Signal Function Set faceplates omit the
`ScrewSilver`/`ScrewBlack` corner screws by design — do not call
`createWidget<ScrewSilver>(...)` (or any screw widget) in a `ModuleWidget`
constructor, for new modules or existing ones. This is intentional and applies
to every module in the plugin.

### Display Widget Conventions
**Any module with a custom NanoVG display widget MUST implement a `drawPreview()` method** for the browser screenshot (`ModuleWidget->module == NULL` during VCV Library thumbnail generation). Without it, the browser thumbnail shows an empty dark slab and tells nothing about what the module does. **The better form is no stand-in at all**: `src/preview.hpp` builds a real instance outside the engine, runs it for a second or two with something to react to, and the display swaps `module` to it for the one draw, so the thumbnail is the live code drawing a live state (Sigma with a preset and a note held, Chime after 2.5 s, Kit struck, Trace with four strokes laid through the real brush). A hand-drawn stand-in is a second copy of the screen and it drifts: Sigma's was still bars an hour after the live view stopped being, and Chime's had every tube dark because the flag that meant preview also meant dim.

See **`docs/conventions/browser-preview-pattern.md`** for the full pattern, examples from every shipped module, and testing instructions. Treat this as a required part of the display widget contract from day one of any new module.

### Panel Design Conventions
Panels are **code**, not Illustrator files. Rack ignores `<text>` in a panel SVG, so labels are drawn at runtime in **Figtree** (bundled in `res/fonts/`, SIL OFL) from `src/panel-style.hpp` — which also holds the palette, the single label size (4.4mm), and the label gaps. Callers state a **control's** position and the header applies the gap, so a moved control takes its label with it.

Remember that Rack draws each component over its own footprint: anything in the SVG the size of a knob or jack is invisible. The visible design is the faceplate, the dark **plates** grouping sections, the screens, and the labels.

A panel redrawn or re-exported from **Figma** needs three fixed translations
(px artboard to mm, runtime labels off because the art outlines its own text,
guide circles read as the layout). Use the **`figma-panel` skill** —
`.claude/skills/figma-panel/scripts/figma_panel.py normalize|grid|check` —
rather than re-deriving them; each fault is silent until you render.

See **`docs/conventions/panel-design.md`**.

### Panel Reticule Conventions
Panel SVGs carry **reticules** — the placement guides the art is drawn around. They are generated from the widget constructor by `tools/panel_reticules.py`, never hand-placed, so they cannot drift from the code:

```bash
python3 tools/panel_reticules.py            # every registered panel
```

Controls are drawn at **99%** of the real component as a **single shape**; screens are **full size** filled with the display blue (`#1a1a32`). The tool owns only the `Screens` and `Reticules` layers and never touches the designer's artwork.

See **`docs/conventions/panel-reticules.md`** for the rules, the component size table, and the 72dpi-vs-75dpi coordinate-space trap.

### Scale Conventions
**Any module exposing a SCALE control MUST use the shared canonical list in `src/scales.hpp`** (namespace `sfs`) — never define its own scale table. The list is append-only; reordering breaks cross-module SCALE CV compatibility and saved patches. Note, Fugue, Fugue's MetaFugue variant, Muse, Chance, and Arrange all alias `sfs::Scale` / `sfs::SCALES[]`, so a SCALE CV (1V/scale) and ROOT CV (1V/oct, semitone-quantized) are interchangeable across all of them. (Fugue was migrated onto the canonical list in 2026-07; a `scaleCanonical` JSON flag + `LEGACY_SCALE_REMAP` translate pre-migration patches.)

See **`docs/conventions/scales.md`** for the 19-scale list, struct fields (longName/shortName/museName, intervals/size, museSemis[8]), and how to add a scale.

## GSX - Granular Synthesis Module

### Overview
GSX is a fully implemented granular synthesis module that replicates the capabilities of Barry Truax's pioneering GSX system (1985-86). It generates dense textures from hundreds of short sound events called "grains," with real-time control over temporal, spectral, and spatial parameters.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** - The module is fully functional and sounds very close to Barry Truax's original GSX system. All 9 parameters, 10 CV inputs, VCA control, and stereo outputs are working correctly.

### Technical Background
Granular synthesis operates in the "microsound" domain (typically 1-50ms grain durations) where changes in the time domain produce changes in the frequency/spectral domain. The module supports both quasi-synchronous granulation (which can produce pitch-like effects through amplitude modulation) and asynchronous/stochastic granulation (which creates evolving textures).

### Parameters

Each parameter has:
- Dedicated control knob
- CV input (±5V bipolar for all parameters, 0-5V unipolar for VCA)
- Range optimized for musical granular synthesis

#### 1. Frequency
- **Range**: 50 Hz to 2000 Hz
- **Default**: 130.81 Hz (C3)
- **Function**: Center frequency of generated grains
- **CV Input**: 1V/octave standard (±∞V, bipolar)
- **Notes**: Center frequency around which grains are generated; lower frequencies produce bass textures, higher frequencies create bright, piercing sounds. CV input multiplies frequency exponentially for musical pitch tracking.

#### 2. Streams
- **Range**: 1 to 20 streams
- **Default**: 10 streams
- **Function**: Number of simultaneous grain generators
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±10 streams (bipolar)
- **Notes**: More streams = denser texture and smoother sound; fewer streams = individual grains more audible. Each stream independently generates up to 20 overlapping grains. Affects CPU load.

#### 3. Shape
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (Sine → Triangle → Sawtooth → Square)
- **Default**: 0.0 (Sine wave)
- **Function**: Grain waveform with continuous morphing
- **CV Input**: ±5V = full range (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0.0=sine (mellow), 0.33=triangle, 0.66=sawtooth, 1.0=square (bright/rich harmonics). Smooth morphing between waveforms for complex timbres.

#### 4. Range
- **Range**: 0 Hz to 500 Hz
- **Default**: 100 Hz
- **Function**: Frequency deviation/bandwidth around center frequency
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±500 Hz (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0 Hz = all grains at same frequency; larger values = wider spectral spread and richer textures. Combined with Variation to control frequency randomness.

#### 5. Duration
- **Range**: 1 ms to 100 ms
- **Default**: 20 ms
- **Function**: Length of individual grains
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±100 ms (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Shorter durations = percussive/granular quality; longer durations = smoother textures. Affects perceived timbre due to time-domain/frequency-domain relationship. Typical microsound domain is 1-50ms.

#### 6. Delay
- **Range**: 0.1 ms to 200 ms
- **Default**: 0.1 ms (minimum, Density is primary control)
- **Function**: Manual override for time between grains
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±200 ms (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Overrides Density when >0.2ms. Lower values = dense/continuous texture; larger values = rhythmic/detached grains. Interacts with Duration to create amplitude modulation effects in quasi-synchronous mode.

#### 7. Density
- **Range**: 1 to 1000 grains per second (per stream)
- **Default**: 100 grains/sec
- **Function**: Primary control for grain generation rate
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±1000 grains/sec (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Primary timing control (converted to delay internally: delay = 1/density). Higher density = more continuous sound; lower density = sparse, scattered grains. Each stream generates grains at this rate.

#### 8. Variation
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Default**: 50%
- **Function**: Amount of stochastic variation applied to grain parameters
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±100% (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0% = quasi-synchronous (regular/pitched); 100% = fully asynchronous (stochastic cloud texture). Adds randomness to frequency (with Range), duration, timing, and spatial position. Uses exponential scaling below 30% for tighter control.

#### 9. Spread
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Default**: 50%
- **Function**: Stereo width and spatial distribution
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±100% (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0% = mono (center); 100% = wide stereo. Controls random panning of individual grains across the stereo field using equal-power panning.

### Inputs/Outputs

#### VCA Input
- **Range**: 0-5V (unipolar)
- **Function**: Linear VCA control over final output
- **Notes**: 0V = silence, 5V = full volume. Applied after intelligent gain scaling. Use for envelope control, ducking, or external amplitude modulation.

#### Left Output
- Stereo left channel output
- VCV Rack level: ±10V
- Contains grain streams with equal-power panning

#### Right Output
- Stereo right channel output
- VCV Rack level: ±10V
- Contains grain streams with equal-power panning

### Synthesis Modes

#### Quasi-Synchronous Mode
- Achieved with low Variation and regular Delay values
- Creates pitch through amplitude modulation
- Grain duration determines modulation frequency (e.g., 20ms = 50Hz modulator)
- Can produce tonal effects despite being grain-based synthesis

#### Asynchronous Mode
- Achieved with high Variation values
- Creates stochastic, cloud-like textures
- No clear pitch relationship
- More typical "granular synthesis" sound

### Panel Layout (Implemented)

- **Knobs (3 rows)**:
  - Row 1 (Y=28.69mm): Frequency, Streams, Shape
  - Row 2 (Y=59.17mm): Range, Duration, Delay

- **Bottom Row (Y=120.13mm)**: VCA input (10.16mm), Left output (40.64mm), Right output (50.8mm)
- **Panel**: res/gsx.svg

### Implementation Details

#### Core DSP Architecture (src/gsx.cpp)
- **20 streams** maximum (MAX_STREAMS = 20)
- **20 grains per stream** (GRAINS_PER_STREAM = 20) for dense textures
- Each grain has **separate envelope and waveform phases** (critical for correct sound):
  - `envelopePhase`: 0-1 over grain lifetime (controls Hann window)
  - `wavePhase`: 0-1, wraps continuously (oscillates at grain frequency)
- Sample rate: 48kHz (VCV Rack standard)

#### Grain Structure
```cpp
struct Grain {
    bool active;
    float envelopePhase;  // 0-1 over grain duration
    float wavePhase;      // 0-1, wraps for oscillation
    float frequency;      // Hz
    float duration;       // seconds
    float pan;           // 0=left, 1=right
};
```

#### Grain Envelope
- **Hann window** used for smooth grain envelope: `0.5 * (1 - cos(2π * phase))`
- Prevents clicks and artifacts
- Applied to grain amplitude based on `envelopePhase`

#### Waveform Generation
- Continuous morphing between 4 waveforms: Sine → Triangle → Sawtooth → Square
- Shape parameter (0-1) controls blend
- Each grain oscillates at its assigned frequency throughout its duration
- Waveform phase advances independently from envelope phase

#### Intelligent Gain Scaling
- Automatic gain compensation based on active grain count
- Formula: `gain = clamp(1.0 / sqrt(activeGrainCount * 0.5), 0.15, 1.0)`
- Prevents clipping with many grains while maintaining presence with few grains
- Scales from 1.0 (1 grain) to 0.15 (100+ grains)
- VCA gain applied after this scaling

#### Temporal Accuracy
- Sample-accurate grain timing for quasi-synchronous mode
- Density primary control: `delay = 1/density`
- Delay parameter overrides when >0.2ms
- Variation adds stochastic offset to timing (exponential scaling below 30%)

#### Spatial Distribution
- Per-grain random panning (not per-stream)
- Equal-power panning law: `leftGain = sqrt(1-pan)`, `rightGain = sqrt(pan)`
- Spread parameter controls width of random distribution

#### Stream Management
- Each stream independently schedules grains
- Round-robin grain allocation within each stream (up to 20 concurrent grains)
- No grain stealing - grains must finish naturally

### Parameter Interaction Examples

**Dense Texture (Cloud):**
- Streams: 15-20
- Duration: 10-30ms
- Delay: 0-5ms (or Density: 200-500 grains/sec)
- Variation: 60-100%
- Spread: 80-100%

**Quasi-Synchronous (Pitched):**
- Streams: 8-12
- Duration: 20ms (for 50Hz modulation)
- Delay: 20ms (matches duration)
- Variation: 5-15%
- Spread: 30-50%

**Sparse Granular (Detached grains):**
- Streams: 3-8
- Duration: 5-15ms
- Delay: 50-200ms
- Variation: 40-80%
- Spread: 60-100%

**Rhythmic Pulse:**
- Streams: 10-15
- Duration: 10-20ms
- Delay: 100-150ms (regular values)
- Variation: 0-10%
- Spread: 20-40%

### Historical Context
Based on Barry Truax's GSX system developed in 1985-86 for the DMX-1000 digital signal processor. First real-time granular synthesis implementation, used to create the seminal work "Riverrun" (1986). This VCV Rack implementation preserves the core algorithmic approach while adapting it to the modular synthesis paradigm with full voltage control.

### Sound Quality
The implemented module sounds **very close** to Barry Truax's original GSX system. The combination of proper envelope/waveform phase separation, Hann window envelopes, intelligent gain scaling, and per-grain random panning creates authentic granular textures in both quasi-synchronous and asynchronous modes.

### Development History
- Initial implementation with all 9 parameters and CV inputs
- Critical bug fix: Separated envelope phase from waveform phase (grains now oscillate at their frequency throughout their duration, not just one cycle)
- Added VCA input for external amplitude control
- Tuned variation scaling (exponential below 30% for quasi-synchronous mode)
- Optimized CV input ranges to ±5V standard (0-5V for VCA)
- Changed default frequency from A4 (440 Hz) to C3 (130.81 Hz)
- Implemented per-grain random panning for authentic stereo spread

### Possible Future Enhancements
- FM synthesis grain mode (add Modulation Index and C:M Ratio parameters)
- Sample-based grains (load audio files for grain source)
- Alternative envelope shapes (Gaussian, Tukey, custom)
- Grain reverse playback option
- Additional spatial modes (circular panning, motion paths)

## Phase - Dual Sample Looper

### Overview
Phase is a dual sample looper inspired by Steve Reich's phase compositions ("It's Gonna Rain," "Piano Phase"). Two loops play the same or different audio samples with independent "sleep" parameters that create gradual phase drift between the loops. Each loop has a mode switch choosing between **Sleep** (silence gap after each cycle) and **Rotate** (continuous content drift like tape machines at slightly different speeds). The module supports forward and reverse playback, per-loop panning, transient detection with clock-triggered jumps, WAV cue point support, adjustable loop regions, and a VCA anti-click mode.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** - The module is fully functional with all parameters, CV inputs, waveform display, transient detection, and loop region controls working correctly.

### How Phase Drift Works
Each loop has a bipolar "sleep" parameter (-500ms to +500ms) and a mode switch:

**Sleep Mode (SLP):** After a loop completes one cycle, it waits the sleep duration before restarting. Positive values add silence; negative values cut the loop short. If Loop A has 10ms sleep and Loop B has 0ms, Loop A's effective period is `sample_length + 10ms` while Loop B's is just `sample_length`. They gradually drift apart.

**Rotate Mode (ROT):** The loop plays continuously with no gaps. The sleep parameter controls a tiny speed offset that causes the content to gradually rotate within the loop — like two tape machines running at slightly different speeds. The read position drifts by `sleepMs` worth of samples per loop cycle. This creates a subtle pitch shift proportional to the drift rate (e.g., 10ms over 5s = 0.2% = ~3.5 cents — inaudible). Negative sleep rotates in the opposite direction.

### Parameters

#### Per Loop (x2: Loop A and Loop B)

##### 1. Sleep
- **Range**: -500 to +500 ms
- **Default**: 0 ms
- **Function**: Controls phase drift amount and direction
- **CV Input**: ±5V, 50ms/V (bipolar)
- **Notes**: In Sleep mode: positive = silence gap, negative = loop ends early. In Rotate mode: positive = drift forward, negative = drift backward. This is the core phasing mechanism.

##### 2. Speed
- **Range**: -4x to +4x
- **Default**: 1x (center of knob is 0/stopped)
- **Function**: Playback speed and direction
- **CV Input**: ±5V, 0.8x/V (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Negative values play in reverse. 0 = stopped. Speed also affects the effective loop period, providing a second axis for phase drift. Center detent is at 0 (stopped), default is 1x.

##### 3. Pan
- **Range**: -1 (full left) to +1 (full right)
- **Default**: 0 (center)
- **Function**: Stereo panning position for this loop
- **CV Input**: ±5V, 0.2/V (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Uses equal-power panning law (cos/sin). Allows positioning each loop in the stereo field independently.

##### 4. Mode Switch (SLP/ROT)
- **Type**: CKSS toggle switch
- **Function**: Selects between Sleep mode (up) and Rotate mode (down) per loop

### Inputs

#### Per Loop (x2)
| Input | Range | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Sleep CV | ±5V | Modulates sleep time (50ms/V) |
| Speed CV | ±5V | Modulates playback speed (0.8x/V) |
| Pan CV | ±5V | Modulates stereo pan (0.2/V) |
| CLK | Trigger | Jump playhead to next detected transient |
| START | 0-10V | Loop start position (0-100% of sample) |
| LEN | 0-10V | Loop length (0-100% of remaining sample after start) |

#### Global
| Input | Range | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| SYNC | Trigger | Reset both loops to their start positions |
| PLAY GATE | Gate | High (>=1V) = play, overrides button state |

### Outputs
| Output | Function |
|--------|----------|
| LEFT | Stereo left mix of both loops |
| RIGHT | Stereo right mix of both loops |

### Controls

#### Play Button
- Green LED latch button
- Toggles play/stop state on click
- When PLAY GATE CV is connected, gate overrides the button state
- Module outputs silence when stopped

#### Sync Button
- Momentary push button
- Resets both loops to their start positions
- Works alongside the SYNC CV input (either triggers a reset)

### Waveform Display

The display occupies the top portion of the module and shows:
- **Top half**: Sample A waveform (blue)
- **Bottom half**: Sample B waveform (orange)
- **Playhead**: White vertical line showing current position per loop
- **Transient markers**: Subtle vertical lines spanning waveform height
- **Loop handles**: Draggable bracket-style start/end handles (solid filled, no transparency stacking)
- **Dim overlay**: Regions outside the active loop are darkened
- **Origin line**: Semi-transparent white line showing where the original sample start has drifted to in rotate mode
- **Rotated waveform**: In rotate mode, the waveform image rotates to match the audio content

#### Loop Region Handles
- Bracket-style handles with 1px vertical bar and horizontal ticks at top/bottom
- Start handles bracket right, end handles bracket left
- Drag sensitivity accounts for zoom level via `getAbsoluteZoom()`
- When START/LEN CV inputs are connected, they override the handle positions
- Loop regions are persisted with patch save/load

### Sample Loading

- Right-click menu: "Load Sample A" / "Load Sample B"
- WAV files supported (mono or stereo, any sample rate — resampled to 48kHz on load)
- Stereo files are mixed down to mono; stereo placement comes from the Pan control
- If only Sample A is loaded, it cascades to Sample B automatically
- Loading Sample B explicitly breaks the cascade
- "Clear Sample A" / "Clear Sample B" removes loaded samples
- Maximum sample length: 10 minutes (28,800,000 samples at 48kHz)
- File paths persist with patch save/load via JSON
- **WAV cue point support**: If the WAV file contains embedded cue points, they are used as transient markers instead of auto-detection. Cue positions are resampled if the file isn't 48kHz. Re-detect Transients from the context menu overrides cues with auto-detection.

### Transient Detection

#### Algorithm
Energy-based onset detection computed once per sample load:
1. RMS energy computed in 1024-sample windows with 256-sample hop
2. High-frequency emphasis via sample differencing (catches transients in noise)
3. Half-wave rectified onset detection function
4. Adaptive threshold based on local mean energy over 30-frame context window
5. Local peak picking with ±2 frame neighborhood
6. Minimum gap enforcement between detected transients
7. Absolute energy floor (0.005) prevents false triggers on quiet/silent passages

#### Context Menu Controls
- **Re-detect Transients**: Re-run detection with current settings (overrides WAV cue points)
- **Sensitivity**: High (0.15), Medium/default (0.7), Low (0.95) — maps to threshold range 1.0-12.0
- **Min Transient Gap**: 10ms (fast), 50ms (medium), 100ms/default (slow)

#### Clock Input Behavior
On rising edge of CLK input, the playhead jumps to the next transient after the current position (within the active loop region). If at the end, wraps to the first transient in the region.

### VCA Mode (Anti-Click)

- **Default**: Enabled
- **Context menu**: "VCA Mode (anti-click)" toggle
- When enabled, applies a 1ms attack/release envelope around all discontinuities:
  - Loop restarts (forward and reverse wrap-around)
  - Transient jumps via clock trigger
  - Sync resets
  - Sleep wake-up transitions
- Eliminates clicks from playhead discontinuities
- Implementation: fade-out (1ms) → execute jump → fade-in (1ms)

```

### Implementation Details

#### Core DSP (src/phase.cpp)
- **Double-precision playhead**: Prevents cumulative drift at fractional speeds over long playback
- **Linear interpolation**: Sub-sample accuracy for non-integer speed values
- **Mono mixdown on load**: Simplifies DSP; stereo placement via per-loop pan control
- **Precomputed waveform overview**: 512-point peak array per sample, no per-frame buffer scanning
- **Equal-power panning**: cos/sin law from bipolar [-1,+1] pan position
- **Continuous drift (rotate mode)**: Read position advances at `speed + (sleepSamples/regionLength)` per sample — no discrete jumps, no crossfade needed

#### Data Structures
```cpp
struct SampleData {
    vector<float> samples;        // Mono float samples at 48kHz
    size_t length;                // Number of samples
    string filePath, fileName;    // For persistence and display
    vector<size_t> transients;    // Precomputed transient positions
    vector<float> waveformMini;   // 512-point peak array for display
    bool loaded;
    bool hasCuePoints;            // true if transients from WAV cue chunk
    float loopStart, loopEnd;     // Normalized 0-1 loop region
};

struct LoopState {
    double playhead;              // Current position (double precision)
    bool sleeping;                // In post-loop silence
    float sleepRemaining;         // Sleep countdown in seconds
    SchmittTrigger clockTrigger;
    float envelope;               // VCA mode anti-click envelope (0-1)
    bool ramping;                 // In fade transition
    double jumpTarget;            // Deferred jump destination
    double rotationOffset;        // Accumulated drift in rotate mode
};
```

#### JSON Persistence
Saves and restores: file paths for both samples, explicit-B flag, play state, transient sensitivity, min gap, VCA mode, and loop start/end regions for both samples.

#### Dependencies
- **dr_wav.h**: Header-only WAV loader (included in src/, `#define DR_WAV_IMPLEMENTATION` in phase.cpp). Opened with `drwav_init_file_with_metadata()` to read cue points.
- **osdialog**: File open dialogs (provided by VCV Rack SDK)
- **NanoVG**: Waveform display drawing (provided by VCV Rack SDK)

### Patch Ideas

**Steve Reich Phase Drift:**
- Load same sample in both loops
- Sleep A: 5-10ms, Sleep B: 0ms
- Speed both at 1x
- Pan A left, Pan B right
- Listen as patterns gradually shift

**Tape Machine Drift (Rotate):**
- Load same sample, set both to Rotate mode
- Sleep A: 5ms, Sleep B: 0ms
- Continuous seamless drift with no gaps
- Content gradually rotates — subtle pitch shift adds to the effect

**Reverse Texture:**
- Speed A: 1x, Speed B: -0.5x
- Same sample, different loop regions
- High variation creates evolving textures

**Transient Slicer:**
- Load rhythmic material
- High sensitivity transient detection
- Clock both loops from an external sequencer at different rates
- Each clock pulse jumps to the next transient

**Granular-Style Scanning:**
- Use LFO on START CV to slowly scan through the sample
- Short LEN CV value for small loop windows
- Different LFO rates on A and B for complex interplay

**Bidirectional Drift:**
- Sleep A: +10ms, Sleep B: -10ms
- Loops drift in opposite directions simultaneously

## Meter - Musical Clock with Time Signature

### Overview
Meter is a musical clock module designed to be the master clock for a Beat-driven rhythm rig. Unlike most VCV clocks, it understands musical structure: time signature, bar boundaries, and beat subdivisions. Six gate outputs cover the common subdivisions (Bar, Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth, Quarter Triplet, Eighth Triplet), each with independent enable and swing controls — so the user can shape the macro feel of an entire patch from one place. The intent is that one Meter drives many Beat instances, each per-instrument, each potentially using a different swung/unswung subdivision as its clock.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** — all subdivision outputs, per-output enable + swing (with mockup-aligned blue/orange display), external clock sync, time signature CV, and reset out are working. Display shows BPM, time signature, bars-since-reset, sync indicator, plus per-output hit indicator rows with swing ghost markers and a position tracker.

### Parameters

| Param | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BPM (huge knob) | 30–300 | 120 | Quarter notes per minute (DAW convention) |
| Numerator (snap knob) | 1–16 | 4 | Top of time signature |
| Denominator (config-switch) | indices 0–5 → 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 | 2 (=4) | Bottom of time signature |
| Run (light latch) | momentary | — | Play/stop toggle |
| Reset (button) | momentary | — | Resets bar to 1, position to 0; fires Reset OUT |
| Per-output Enable (×6) | latch w/ green LED | on | Mute that subdivision output |
| Per-output Swing (×5, no swing on BAR) | -0.5 .. +0.5 | 0 | Standard convention: positive = off-beats delayed |

### Inputs
- **BPM CV** (~27 BPM/V)
- **Numerator CV / Denominator CV** (CV stepping)
- **Run gate** (overrides Run button when patched)
- **External clock** (overrides internal BPM; PPQN configurable via context menu: 1/2/4/8/12/16/24)
- Per-output **Enable CV** (×6, gate input that overrides the latch)
- Per-output **Swing CV** (×5, ±5V → ±50%)

### Outputs
All gate outputs are 1ms 10V pulses via `dsp::PulseGenerator`:
- **BAR** (downbeat per bar)
- **QUARTER** / **EIGHTH** / **SIXTEENTH**
- **QUARTER TRIPLET** / **EIGHTH TRIPLET**
- **RESET OUT** (1ms trigger; fires when the Reset button is pressed — Meter is the master, downstream modules receive reset via this jack)

### Display

Top status line:
- Left: current BPM (numeric)
- Sync indicator (right of BPM, only when EXT CLOCK is patched): small dot, dim orange at rest, flashes bright on each external clock pulse, decays over ~100ms
- Center (large): time signature `4/4`, with optional pending `→ 7/8` to the right when a change is queued
- Right: `BAR N` counter, increments on each bar wrap, resets to 1 on Reset

Six per-output hit indicator rows above the position tracker. Each row shows tick marks for that output's pulse positions across the bar, with:
- Swing ghosts (dim ticks at un-swung positions) plus connector lines from ghost → actual position
- A pulse flash that lerps blue → orange when the pulse fires (decays over ~100ms)
- Disabled rows render in dim purple

Position tracker at the bottom: one cell per sixteenth-note in the bar, with the current sixteenth highlighted orange, beat boundaries shown in mid-purple, and other cells dim purple.

### DSP Design

#### Per-subdivision phase accumulators
Each subdivision (Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth, Quarter Triplet, Eighth Triplet) maintains its own `samplesSinceX` accumulator and `pulseCountX` counter. Per sample:
- `samplesPerQuarter = 60 * sampleRate / effectiveBpm`
- `eTarget = swingAdjustedPeriod(pulseCountX, basePeriod, activeSwing[X])`
- When `samplesSinceX >= eTarget`, fire the pulse, subtract eTarget, increment pulse count

#### Bar tracking
SIXTEENTH drives `sixteenthCount`. When it reaches `sixteenthsPerBar = numerator * 16 / denominator`, the bar wraps:
- `sixteenthCount = 0`
- `barsSinceReset++`
- BAR pulse fires
- Triplet phases reset to 0 (so triplets always realign with the downbeat)
- Pending swing values copied to active swing (per-bar latching — see "Swing latching" below)

#### Swing math
```cpp
// pulseCount = pulses already fired since reset.
// Next pulse to fire is pulse (pulseCount + 1).
// Off-beats are pulses 1, 3, 5... (odd index).
bool nextIsOffBeat = (pulseCount % 2) == 0;
return basePeriod * (nextIsOffBeat ? (1 + swing) : (1 - swing));
```
Each pair of (on-beat → off-beat → on-beat) periods sums to exactly 2*base, so on-beats always land on the grid regardless of swing amount. Swing range is ±0.5 (off-beat pulled all the way to the next on-beat at +0.5, all the way to the previous on-beat at -0.5).

#### Swing latching (CRITICAL)
Mid-period swing changes would corrupt the accumulator (the threshold being raced toward changes mid-race), causing notes to fire early or get swallowed. To prevent this:
- `pendingSwing[i]` is read from knob+CV every sample
- `activeSwing[i]` is what `swingAdjustedPeriod` actually uses
- On bar boundary (and on Reset), `activeSwing = pendingSwing`
- On the very first process call, also commit (so initial knob position takes effect immediately)
- Display reflects `pendingSwing` (so the visualization stays responsive while the audio waits for the bar boundary)

#### External clock sync
On each rising edge of EXT CLOCK:
- Measure samples since last pulse → `samplesPerQuarter = samples_between * ppqn`
- `measuredBpmRaw = clamp(60 * sampleRate / samplesPerQuarter, 30, 300)`
- One-pole LPF (coefficient 0.1) toward `measuredBpm`
- Sync indicator flash set to 1.0
- When EXT is connected and has a measurement, `effectiveBpm = measuredBpm`; otherwise `effectiveBpm = bpmKnob + bpmCV`

#### Pulse flash (display only)
Each output has a `pulseFlash[i]` brightness (0..1, decays over 100ms), `pulseFlashIdx[i]` (which tick within the bar most recently fired), and `pulseInBar[i]` (running counter, reset on bar wrap). When BAR fires on the same sample as another subdivision's downbeat, the flash indices for those subdivisions are post-corrected to point at tick 0 of the new bar (rather than the last tick of the old bar).

### Panel Layout (18HP = 91.44mm)

Two-column left side (x=8, x=22):
- BPM huge knob (centered between columns at x=15)
- Y=58: EXT clock | BPM CV
- Y=72: NUM knob | DEN knob
- Y=84: NUM CV | DEN CV
- Y=98: RUN latch | RST button
- Y=110: RUN gate (in) | RESET OUT (with dark plate behind)

Right side: 6 output rows at y=44, 57, 70, 83, 96, 109. Each row has:
- Enable button (latch+LED) at x=44
- Enable CV at x=53
- Swing trimpot at x=65 (omitted on BAR row)
- Swing CV at x=74 (omitted on BAR row)
- Output jack at x=86 (with dark plate behind for visual separation)

### Context Menu
- External Clock PPQN selector (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24)
- "Apply time signature changes immediately" toggle (default off — changes queue for next bar)
- "Reset on play" toggle (default off — Run after Stop resumes from current position)
- "Detected: NN.N BPM" label when ext clock is connected and measuring

### Persistence
JSON saves: running state, ext clock PPQN index, applyTimeSigImmediately, resetOnPlay, outputEnabled[6], barsSinceReset.

## Beat - Per-Voice Pattern Sequencer

### Overview
Beat is a single-voice pattern sequencer designed to be paired with Meter (or any clock+bar source). One Beat instance = one drum/voice. Eight patterns × sixteen steps each, with per-step velocity, accent, and probability. Per-pattern length (1–16) and per-pattern repeat count (1–8 bars) define the macro structure. Most editing happens on the screen — the panel is a narrow 10HP with just the display + jacks.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** — full edit modes (STEPS / VEL / ACC / PROB), drag-to-paint/scrub across all sequential elements, double-click to toggle pattern active state, on-screen length and repeat count controls, blue/orange Beat-design palette, connector rails between mode tabs/step-grid and pattern-selector/repeats-bar, and persistent state.

### Per-pattern Data (×8 patterns)
- `bool steps[16]` — gate on/off per step
- `float velocities[16]` — 0..1 per step (drives 0..10V VEL output)
- `bool accents[16]` — accent flag per step (drives 1ms ACC pulse)
- `float probabilities[16]` — 0..1 chance the step actually fires when reached
- `int length` — 1..16 (step count per loop)
- `int repeats` — 1..8 (number of bars to play this pattern before advancing)
- `bool active` — included in the pattern rotation

### Inputs
- **CLOCK** — advances the step counter
- **BAR** — advances to the next active pattern (with `repeats` honored)
- **RESET** — returns to first active pattern, step 0
- **MUTE** (gate ≥1V) — silences all three outputs

### Outputs
- **GATE** — 1ms 10V pulse on each fired step
- **VELOCITY** — sample-and-hold CV 0..10V (the previous step's velocity stays held until the next fire)
- **ACCENT** — 1ms 10V pulse on accented steps

### Display Layout (mockup-aligned)

Mockup uses a 174 × 155 unit display (= 46 × 41 mm). Internal coordinates use a `s = w / 174` scale factor for unit conversion. Display origin is at panel `(2.4, 12)` mm.

Top to bottom:
1. **Mode tabs row** (y=8, height 18): 4 cells of 38×18 at x = 7, 47, 87, 127 — `STEPS / VEL / ACC / PROB`. Selected tab = dark blue (`#0D5986`); inactive = dim purple.
2. **Top connector rail** at y=32 (between mode tabs and step grid) — horizontal `#0D5988` line spanning x=7..165, with a short vertical stem from the active mode tab's center.
3. **Step grid** (y=35..73): 2 rows × 8 cols of 18×18 cells. Cells colored:
   - Out of length → very dim (`#1A1A32`)
   - Active step → blue (`#0097DE`)
   - Active step + currently-playing → orange (`#EC652E`)
   - Inactive step at beat boundary (idx % 4 == 0) → mid purple (`#4A4A66`)
   - Inactive step elsewhere → dim purple (`#35354D`)
4. **Length dots** (y=75): 16 small 8×8 dots at x = 7+i*10. Lit (blue) for `i < length`, dim for the rest.
5. **PATTERN label** (y=103, baseline): white text matching mode tab font size, left-aligned.
6. **Pattern selector** (y=111..129): 8 cells of 18×18 with pattern numbers 1–8 slightly above center. Loop-count dots row at the bottom of each cell, centered horizontally — N dots where N = pattern's repeats. The dot at `currentBar - 1` lights bright on the playing pattern; others stay dim.
7. **Bottom connector rail** at y=134.5 (between pattern selector and repeats bar) — same style as the top rail, with a stem from the edit pattern's center.
8. **Repeats bar** (y=137..145): 8 cells of 18×8. Cell colors: orange for current playhead bar, blue for in-range cells (`i < reps`), dim purple for out-of-range.

### Edit Mode Behaviors

**STEPS mode**: Click toggles a step on/off. Drag paints subsequent cells with the same new state (only within current pattern length — drag won't extend length, but click can).

**VEL mode**: Click a cell to set velocity by Y position within the cell (top = 1.0, bottom = 0.0). Vertical drag adjusts further. Auto-enables the step. Cell renders a bottom-up white overlay sized to velocity (60% white in VEL mode, 10% white as a hint in STEPS/ACC modes — skipped entirely in PROB mode).

**ACC mode**: Click toggles the accent flag (auto-enables the step). Drag paints. Accent shows as an unfilled white circle at the cell center — full opacity in ACC mode, 10% opacity hint elsewhere.

**PROB mode**: Same vertical-drag behavior as VEL but writes to `probabilities[]`. Fired probabilistically in DSP via `random::uniform() >= probabilities[step]`. Renders a 60% white bottom-up overlay (only in PROB mode — no faint hints in other modes to avoid clutter).

### Pattern Selector Interactions
- **Left-click**: select for editing (also drag across cells to scrub edit pattern)
- **Double-click**: toggle pattern active/inactive (replaced the previous right-click for better discoverability)
- Inactive patterns are skipped in the rotation

### Length Dots / Repeats Bar Interactions
- **Click** any length dot → set length to that index + 1
- **Drag** across length dots → scrub length 1..16
- **Click** any repeats cell → set repeats to that index + 1
- **Drag** across repeats cells → scrub repeats 1..8
- Scroll-wheel over a pattern cell → adjust that pattern's repeats (alternative shortcut)

### DSP Logic

#### Bar / clock coincidence
Meter typically fires BAR and downbeat-EIGHTH/QUARTER/SIXTEENTH on the same sample. Beat collapses these into a single event: if BAR fired this sample OR if BAR voltage is currently high (still within its 1ms pulse window), CLOCK is suppressed. This handles either-direction sub-sample drift between Meter outputs.

#### Pattern advance
- BAR pulse: `currentBar++`. If `currentBar > repeats`, advance to `nextActivePattern(playPattern)` and `currentBar = 1`. Reset `playStep = 0`. Fire step.
- CLOCK pulse: `playStep = (playStep + 1) % length`. Fire step if active and probability check passes.

#### "Advance only on bar trigger" (default ON)
Context menu toggle. When ON (default), pattern advances only happen on BAR pulse — even if BAR isn't patched, the pattern just loops the same one indefinitely. When OFF (legacy fallback), pattern wrap also advances when BAR isn't connected.

#### Fire logic
```cpp
void fireStepIfActive() {
    if (!steps[playStep]) return;
    if (random::uniform() >= probabilities[playStep]) return;
    gatePulse.trigger(0.001f);
    currentVelocity = clamp(velocities[playStep], 0.f, 1.f);
    if (accents[playStep]) accentPulse.trigger(0.001f);
}
```

### Panel Layout (10HP)
- Display: x=2.4, y=12, 46mm × 41mm
- Inputs row at y=80: CLK (x=8), BAR (x=20), RST (x=32), MUTE (x=44)
- Outputs row at y=110 (with dark plates): GATE (x=10), VEL (x=25.4), ACC (x=40.8)

### Context Menu
- "Advance only on bar trigger" (default ON) — see DSP section above
- Patterns submenu:
  - Randomize current pattern steps (50% density, doesn't touch velocity/accent/probability)
  - Clear current pattern
  - Clear all patterns

### Persistence
JSON saves: editPattern, editMode, playPattern, playStep, currentBar, advanceOnBarOnly, and per-pattern: active, length, repeats, steps[16], velocities[16], accents[16], probabilities[16].

### Default State
On Initialize: only pattern 1 active (enable more via double-click or the per-cell right-click menu). `advanceOnBarOnly = true`. EditMode = STEPS, EditPattern = 0. Pattern selector right-click menu: Enable/Disable, Copy pattern, Paste pattern (clipboard shared across instances; paste preserves the target's active state). Same for Note.

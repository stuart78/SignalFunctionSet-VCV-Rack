### Module Development Pattern
Each module follows the VCV Rack module pattern:
- Inherits from `Module` class
- Defines `ParamId`, `InputId`, `OutputId`, and `LightId` enums
- Implements `process()` method for audio processing
- Has corresponding widget class for UI

### Display Widget Conventions
**Any module with a custom NanoVG display widget MUST implement a `drawPreview()` method** for the browser screenshot (`ModuleWidget->module == NULL` during VCV Library thumbnail generation). Without it, the browser thumbnail shows an empty dark slab and tells nothing about what the module does.

See **`docs/conventions/browser-preview-pattern.md`** for the full pattern, examples from every shipped module, and testing instructions. Treat this as a required part of the display widget contract from day one of any new module.

### Scale Conventions
**Any module exposing a SCALE control MUST use the shared canonical list in `src/scales.hpp`** (namespace `sfs`) — never define its own scale table. The list is append-only; reordering breaks cross-module SCALE CV compatibility and saved patches. Note, Fugue, and Muse all alias `sfs::Scale` / `sfs::SCALES[]`.

See **`docs/conventions/scales.md`** for the 19-scale list, struct fields (longName/shortName/museName, intervals/size, museSemis[8]), and how to add a scale.

### Drift Module Architecture
The Drift module implements:
- 4 phase-shifted LFO outputs (A, B, C, D)
- Lorenz attractor chaos system for each output
- Parameters: shape, stability, frequency, X spread, center, Y spread
- Inputs: CV control for all parameters
- Outputs: min/max values plus 4 LFO outputs

### Resources
- `res/` directory contains SVG panel designs
- `plugin.json` defines plugin metadata and module listings
- Panel SVGs are referenced by module widgets for UI rendering

## Development Notes

- The plugin uses VCV Rack SDK framework
- Module widgets are defined in the same file as the module implementation
- SVG panels in `res/` directory define the visual appearance
- Build artifacts go to `build/` and distribution files to `dist/`

## GSX - Granular Synthesis Module

### Overview
GSX is a fully implemented granular synthesis module that replicates the capabilities of Barry Truax's pioneering GSX system (1985-86). It generates dense textures from hundreds of short sound events called "grains," with real-time control over temporal, spectral, and spatial parameters.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** - The module is fully functional and sounds very close to Barry Truax's original GSX system. All 9 parameters, 10 CV inputs, VCA control, and stereo outputs are working correctly.

### Technical Background
Granular synthesis operates in the "microsound" domain (typically 1-50ms grain durations) where changes in the time domain produce changes in the frequency/spectral domain. The module supports both quasi-synchronous granulation (which can produce pitch-like effects through amplitude modulation) and asynchronous/stochastic granulation (which creates evolving textures).

### Parameters

Each parameter has:
- Dedicated control knob
- CV input (±5V bipolar for all parameters, 0-5V unipolar for VCA)
- Range optimized for musical granular synthesis

#### 1. Frequency
- **Range**: 50 Hz to 2000 Hz
- **Default**: 130.81 Hz (C3)
- **Function**: Center frequency of generated grains
- **CV Input**: 1V/octave standard (±∞V, bipolar)
- **Notes**: Center frequency around which grains are generated; lower frequencies produce bass textures, higher frequencies create bright, piercing sounds. CV input multiplies frequency exponentially for musical pitch tracking.

#### 2. Streams
- **Range**: 1 to 20 streams
- **Default**: 10 streams
- **Function**: Number of simultaneous grain generators
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±10 streams (bipolar)
- **Notes**: More streams = denser texture and smoother sound; fewer streams = individual grains more audible. Each stream independently generates up to 20 overlapping grains. Affects CPU load.

#### 3. Shape
- **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0 (Sine → Triangle → Sawtooth → Square)
- **Default**: 0.0 (Sine wave)
- **Function**: Grain waveform with continuous morphing
- **CV Input**: ±5V = full range (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0.0=sine (mellow), 0.33=triangle, 0.66=sawtooth, 1.0=square (bright/rich harmonics). Smooth morphing between waveforms for complex timbres.

#### 4. Range
- **Range**: 0 Hz to 500 Hz
- **Default**: 100 Hz
- **Function**: Frequency deviation/bandwidth around center frequency
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±500 Hz (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0 Hz = all grains at same frequency; larger values = wider spectral spread and richer textures. Combined with Variation to control frequency randomness.

#### 5. Duration
- **Range**: 1 ms to 100 ms
- **Default**: 20 ms
- **Function**: Length of individual grains
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±100 ms (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Shorter durations = percussive/granular quality; longer durations = smoother textures. Affects perceived timbre due to time-domain/frequency-domain relationship. Typical microsound domain is 1-50ms.

#### 6. Delay
- **Range**: 0.1 ms to 200 ms
- **Default**: 0.1 ms (minimum, Density is primary control)
- **Function**: Manual override for time between grains
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±200 ms (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Overrides Density when >0.2ms. Lower values = dense/continuous texture; larger values = rhythmic/detached grains. Interacts with Duration to create amplitude modulation effects in quasi-synchronous mode.

#### 7. Density
- **Range**: 1 to 1000 grains per second (per stream)
- **Default**: 100 grains/sec
- **Function**: Primary control for grain generation rate
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±1000 grains/sec (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Primary timing control (converted to delay internally: delay = 1/density). Higher density = more continuous sound; lower density = sparse, scattered grains. Each stream generates grains at this rate.

#### 8. Variation
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Default**: 50%
- **Function**: Amount of stochastic variation applied to grain parameters
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±100% (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0% = quasi-synchronous (regular/pitched); 100% = fully asynchronous (stochastic cloud texture). Adds randomness to frequency (with Range), duration, timing, and spatial position. Uses exponential scaling below 30% for tighter control.

#### 9. Spread
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Default**: 50%
- **Function**: Stereo width and spatial distribution
- **CV Input**: ±5V = ±100% (bipolar)
- **Notes**: 0% = mono (center); 100% = wide stereo. Controls random panning of individual grains across the stereo field using equal-power panning.

### Inputs/Outputs

#### VCA Input
- **Range**: 0-5V (unipolar)
- **Function**: Linear VCA control over final output
- **Notes**: 0V = silence, 5V = full volume. Applied after intelligent gain scaling. Use for envelope control, ducking, or external amplitude modulation.

#### Left Output
- Stereo left channel output
- VCV Rack level: ±10V
- Contains grain streams with equal-power panning

#### Right Output
- Stereo right channel output
- VCV Rack level: ±10V
- Contains grain streams with equal-power panning

### Synthesis Modes

#### Quasi-Synchronous Mode
- Achieved with low Variation and regular Delay values
- Creates pitch through amplitude modulation
- Grain duration determines modulation frequency (e.g., 20ms = 50Hz modulator)
- Can produce tonal effects despite being grain-based synthesis

#### Asynchronous Mode
- Achieved with high Variation values
- Creates stochastic, cloud-like textures
- No clear pitch relationship
- More typical "granular synthesis" sound

### Panel Layout (Implemented)
- **Width**: 3-column design at X positions: 10.16mm, 30.48mm, 50.8mm
- **Knobs (3 rows)**:
  - Row 1 (Y=28.69mm): Frequency, Streams, Shape
  - Row 2 (Y=59.17mm): Range, Duration, Delay
  - Row 3 (Y=89.65mm): Density, Variation, Spread
- **CV Inputs (positioned directly below knobs)**:
  - Row 1 (Y=41.39mm): Frequency CV, Streams CV, Shape CV
  - Row 2 (Y=71.87mm): Range CV, Duration CV, Delay CV
  - Row 3 (Y=102.35mm): Density CV, Variation CV, Spread CV
- **Bottom Row (Y=120.13mm)**: VCA input (10.16mm), Left output (40.64mm), Right output (50.8mm)
- **Panel**: res/gsx.svg

### Implementation Details

#### Core DSP Architecture (src/gsx.cpp)
- **20 streams** maximum (MAX_STREAMS = 20)
- **20 grains per stream** (GRAINS_PER_STREAM = 20) for dense textures
- Each grain has **separate envelope and waveform phases** (critical for correct sound):
  - `envelopePhase`: 0-1 over grain lifetime (controls Hann window)
  - `wavePhase`: 0-1, wraps continuously (oscillates at grain frequency)
- Sample rate: 48kHz (VCV Rack standard)

#### Grain Structure
```cpp
struct Grain {
    bool active;
    float envelopePhase;  // 0-1 over grain duration
    float wavePhase;      // 0-1, wraps for oscillation
    float frequency;      // Hz
    float duration;       // seconds
    float pan;           // 0=left, 1=right
};
```

#### Grain Envelope
- **Hann window** used for smooth grain envelope: `0.5 * (1 - cos(2π * phase))`
- Prevents clicks and artifacts
- Applied to grain amplitude based on `envelopePhase`

#### Waveform Generation
- Continuous morphing between 4 waveforms: Sine → Triangle → Sawtooth → Square
- Shape parameter (0-1) controls blend
- Each grain oscillates at its assigned frequency throughout its duration
- Waveform phase advances independently from envelope phase

#### Intelligent Gain Scaling
- Automatic gain compensation based on active grain count
- Formula: `gain = clamp(1.0 / sqrt(activeGrainCount * 0.5), 0.15, 1.0)`
- Prevents clipping with many grains while maintaining presence with few grains
- Scales from 1.0 (1 grain) to 0.15 (100+ grains)
- VCA gain applied after this scaling

#### Temporal Accuracy
- Sample-accurate grain timing for quasi-synchronous mode
- Density primary control: `delay = 1/density`
- Delay parameter overrides when >0.2ms
- Variation adds stochastic offset to timing (exponential scaling below 30%)

#### Spatial Distribution
- Per-grain random panning (not per-stream)
- Equal-power panning law: `leftGain = sqrt(1-pan)`, `rightGain = sqrt(pan)`
- Spread parameter controls width of random distribution

#### Stream Management
- Each stream independently schedules grains
- Round-robin grain allocation within each stream (up to 20 concurrent grains)
- No grain stealing - grains must finish naturally

### Parameter Interaction Examples

- Streams: 15-20
- Duration: 10-30ms
- Delay: 0-5ms (or Density: 200-500 grains/sec)
- Variation: 60-100%
- Spread: 80-100%

**Quasi-Synchronous (Pitched):**
- Streams: 8-12
- Duration: 20ms (for 50Hz modulation)

- Spread: 60-100%

**Rhythmic Pulse:**
- Streams: 10-15
- Duration: 10-20ms
- Delay: 100-150ms (regular values)
- Variation: 0-10%
- Spread: 20-40%

### Historical Context
Based on Barry Truax's GSX system developed in 1985-86 for the DMX-1000 digital signal processor. First real-time granular synthesis implementation, used to create the seminal work "Riverrun" (1986). This VCV Rack implementation preserves the core algorithmic approach while adapting it to the modular synthesis paradigm with full voltage control.

### Sound Quality
The implemented module sounds **very close** to Barry Truax's original GSX system. The combination of proper envelope/waveform phase separation, Hann window envelopes, intelligent gain scaling, and per-grain random panning creates authentic granular textures in both quasi-synchronous and asynchronous modes.

### Development History
- Initial implementation with all 9 parameters and CV inputs
- Critical bug fix: Separated envelope phase from waveform phase (grains now oscillate at their frequency throughout their duration, not just one cycle)
- Added VCA input for external amplitude control
- Tuned variation scaling (exponential below 30% for quasi-synchronous mode)
- Optimized CV input ranges to ±5V standard (0-5V for VCA)
- Changed default frequency from A4 (440 Hz) to C3 (130.81 Hz)
- Implemented per-grain random panning for authentic stereo spread

### Possible Future Enhancements
- FM synthesis grain mode (add Modulation Index and C:M Ratio parameters)
- Sample-based grains (load audio files for grain source)
- Alternative envelope shapes (Gaussian, Tukey, custom)
- Grain reverse playback option
- Additional spatial modes (circular panning, motion paths)

## Phase - Dual Sample Looper

### Overview
Phase is a dual sample looper inspired by Steve Reich's phase compositions ("It's Gonna Rain," "Piano Phase"). Two loops play the same or different audio samples with independent "sleep" parameters that create gradual phase drift between the loops. Each loop has a mode switch choosing between **Sleep** (silence gap after each cycle) and **Rotate** (continuous content drift like tape machines at slightly different speeds). The module supports forward and reverse playback, per-loop panning, transient detection with clock-triggered jumps, WAV cue point support, adjustable loop regions, and a VCA anti-click mode.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** - The module is fully functional with all parameters, CV inputs, waveform display, transient detection, and loop region controls working correctly.

### How Phase Drift Works
Each loop has a bipolar "sleep" parameter (-500ms to +500ms) and a mode switch:

**Sleep Mode (SLP):** After a loop completes one cycle, it waits the sleep duration before restarting. Positive values add silence; negative values cut the loop short. If Loop A has 10ms sleep and Loop B has 0ms, Loop A's effective period is `sample_length + 10ms` while Loop B's is just `sample_length`. They gradually drift apart.

**Rotate Mode (ROT):** The loop plays continuously with no gaps. The sleep parameter controls a tiny speed offset that causes the content to gradually rotate within the loop — like two tape machines running at slightly different speeds. The read position drifts by `sleepMs` worth of samples per loop cycle. This creates a subtle pitch shift proportional to the drift rate (e.g., 10ms over 5s = 0.2% = ~3.5 cents — inaudible). Negative sleep rotates in the opposite direction.

### Parameters

#### Per Loop (x2: Loop A and Loop B)

##### 1. Sleep
- **Range**: -500 to +500 ms
- **Default**: 0 ms
- **Function**: Controls phase drift amount and direction
- **CV Input**: ±5V, 50ms/V (bipolar)
- **Notes**: In Sleep mode: positive = silence gap, negative = loop ends early. In Rotate mode: positive = drift forward, negative = drift backward. This is the core phasing mechanism.

##### 2. Speed
- **Range**: -4x to +4x
- **Default**: 1x (center of knob is 0/stopped)
- **Function**: Playback speed and direction
- **CV Input**: ±5V, 0.8x/V (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Negative values play in reverse. 0 = stopped. Speed also affects the effective loop period, providing a second axis for phase drift. Center detent is at 0 (stopped), default is 1x.

##### 3. Pan
- **Range**: -1 (full left) to +1 (full right)
- **Default**: 0 (center)
- **Function**: Stereo panning position for this loop
- **CV Input**: ±5V, 0.2/V (bipolar)
- **Notes**: Uses equal-power panning law (cos/sin). Allows positioning each loop in the stereo field independently.

##### 4. Mode Switch (SLP/ROT)
- **Type**: CKSS toggle switch
- **Function**: Selects between Sleep mode (up) and Rotate mode (down) per loop

### Inputs

#### Per Loop (x2)
| Input | Range | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Sleep CV | ±5V | Modulates sleep time (50ms/V) |
| Speed CV | ±5V | Modulates playback speed (0.8x/V) |
| Pan CV | ±5V | Modulates stereo pan (0.2/V) |
| CLK | Trigger | Jump playhead to next detected transient |
| START | 0-10V | Loop start position (0-100% of sample) |
| LEN | 0-10V | Loop length (0-100% of remaining sample after start) |

#### Global
| Input | Range | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| SYNC | Trigger | Reset both loops to their start positions |
| PLAY GATE | Gate | High (>=1V) = play, overrides button state |

### Outputs
| Output | Function |
|--------|----------|
| LEFT | Stereo left mix of both loops |
| RIGHT | Stereo right mix of both loops |

### Controls

#### Play Button
- Green LED latch button
- Toggles play/stop state on click
- When PLAY GATE CV is connected, gate overrides the button state
- Module outputs silence when stopped

#### Sync Button
- Momentary push button
- Resets both loops to their start positions
- Works alongside the SYNC CV input (either triggers a reset)

### Waveform Display

The display occupies the top portion of the module and shows:
- **Top half**: Sample A waveform (blue)
- **Bottom half**: Sample B waveform (orange)
- **Playhead**: White vertical line showing current position per loop
- **Transient markers**: Subtle vertical lines spanning waveform height
- **Loop handles**: Draggable bracket-style start/end handles (solid filled, no transparency stacking)
- **Dim overlay**: Regions outside the active loop are darkened
- **Origin line**: Semi-transparent white line showing where the original sample start has drifted to in rotate mode
- **Rotated waveform**: In rotate mode, the waveform image rotates to match the audio content

#### Loop Region Handles
- Bracket-style handles with 1px vertical bar and horizontal ticks at top/bottom
- Start handles bracket right, end handles bracket left
- Drag sensitivity accounts for zoom level via `getAbsoluteZoom()`
- When START/LEN CV inputs are connected, they override the handle positions
- Loop regions are persisted with patch save/load

### Sample Loading

- Right-click menu: "Load Sample A" / "Load Sample B"
- WAV files supported (mono or stereo, any sample rate — resampled to 48kHz on load)
- Stereo files are mixed down to mono; stereo placement comes from the Pan control
- If only Sample A is loaded, it cascades to Sample B automatically
- Loading Sample B explicitly breaks the cascade
- "Clear Sample A" / "Clear Sample B" removes loaded samples
- Maximum sample length: 10 minutes (28,800,000 samples at 48kHz)
- File paths persist with patch save/load via JSON
- **WAV cue point support**: If the WAV file contains embedded cue points, they are used as transient markers instead of auto-detection. Cue positions are resampled if the file isn't 48kHz. Re-detect Transients from the context menu overrides cues with auto-detection.

### Transient Detection

#### Algorithm
Energy-based onset detection computed once per sample load:
1. RMS energy computed in 1024-sample windows with 256-sample hop
2. High-frequency emphasis via sample differencing (catches transients in noise)
3. Half-wave rectified onset detection function
4. Adaptive threshold based on local mean energy over 30-frame context window
5. Local peak picking with ±2 frame neighborhood
6. Minimum gap enforcement between detected transients
7. Absolute energy floor (0.005) prevents false triggers on quiet/silent passages

#### Context Menu Controls
- **Re-detect Transients**: Re-run detection with current settings (overrides WAV cue points)
- **Sensitivity**: High (0.15), Medium/default (0.7), Low (0.95) — maps to threshold range 1.0-12.0
- **Min Transient Gap**: 10ms (fast), 50ms (medium), 100ms/default (slow)

#### Clock Input Behavior
On rising edge of CLK input, the playhead jumps to the next transient after the current position (within the active loop region). If at the end, wraps to the first transient in the region.

### VCA Mode (Anti-Click)

- **Default**: Enabled
- **Context menu**: "VCA Mode (anti-click)" toggle
- When enabled, applies a 1ms attack/release envelope around all discontinuities:
  - Loop restarts (forward and reverse wrap-around)
  - Transient jumps via clock trigger
  - Sync resets
  - Sleep wake-up transitions
- Eliminates clicks from playhead discontinuities
- Implementation: fade-out (1ms) → execute jump → fade-in (1ms)

  Play(15.24)  PlayGate(25.4)  Sync(45.72)  SyncCV(56)  Left(76.2)  Right(91.44)
```

### Implementation Details

#### Core DSP (src/phase.cpp)
- **Double-precision playhead**: Prevents cumulative drift at fractional speeds over long playback
- **Linear interpolation**: Sub-sample accuracy for non-integer speed values
- **Mono mixdown on load**: Simplifies DSP; stereo placement via per-loop pan control
- **Precomputed waveform overview**: 512-point peak array per sample, no per-frame buffer scanning
- **Equal-power panning**: cos/sin law from bipolar [-1,+1] pan position
- **Continuous drift (rotate mode)**: Read position advances at `speed + (sleepSamples/regionLength)` per sample — no discrete jumps, no crossfade needed

#### Data Structures
```cpp
struct SampleData {
    vector<float> samples;        // Mono float samples at 48kHz
    size_t length;                // Number of samples
    string filePath, fileName;    // For persistence and display
    vector<size_t> transients;    // Precomputed transient positions
    vector<float> waveformMini;   // 512-point peak array for display
    bool loaded;
    bool hasCuePoints;            // true if transients from WAV cue chunk
    float loopStart, loopEnd;     // Normalized 0-1 loop region
};

struct LoopState {
    double playhead;              // Current position (double precision)
    bool sleeping;                // In post-loop silence
    float sleepRemaining;         // Sleep countdown in seconds
    SchmittTrigger clockTrigger;
    float envelope;               // VCA mode anti-click envelope (0-1)
    bool ramping;                 // In fade transition
    double jumpTarget;            // Deferred jump destination
    double rotationOffset;        // Accumulated drift in rotate mode
};
```

#### JSON Persistence
Saves and restores: file paths for both samples, explicit-B flag, play state, transient sensitivity, min gap, VCA mode, and loop start/end regions for both samples.

#### Dependencies
- **dr_wav.h**: Header-only WAV loader (included in src/, `#define DR_WAV_IMPLEMENTATION` in phase.cpp). Opened with `drwav_init_file_with_metadata()` to read cue points.
- **osdialog**: File open dialogs (provided by VCV Rack SDK)
- **NanoVG**: Waveform display drawing (provided by VCV Rack SDK)

### Patch Ideas

**Steve Reich Phase Drift:**
- Load same sample in both loops
- Sleep A: 5-10ms, Sleep B: 0ms
- Speed both at 1x
- Pan A left, Pan B right
- Listen as patterns gradually shift

**Tape Machine Drift (Rotate):**
- Load same sample, set both to Rotate mode
- Sleep A: 5ms, Sleep B: 0ms
- Continuous seamless drift with no gaps
- Content gradually rotates — subtle pitch shift adds to the effect

**Reverse Texture:**
- Speed A: 1x, Speed B: -0.5x
- Same sample, different loop regions
- High variation creates evolving textures

**Transient Slicer:**
- Load rhythmic material
- High sensitivity transient detection
- Clock both loops from an external sequencer at different rates
- Each clock pulse jumps to the next transient

**Granular-Style Scanning:**
- Use LFO on START CV to slowly scan through the sample
- Short LEN CV value for small loop windows
- Different LFO rates on A and B for complex interplay

**Bidirectional Drift:**

## Meter - Musical Clock with Time Signature

### Overview
Meter is a musical clock module designed to be the master clock for a Beat-driven rhythm rig. Unlike most VCV clocks, it understands musical structure: time signature, bar boundaries, and beat subdivisions. Six gate outputs cover the common subdivisions (Bar, Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth, Quarter Triplet, Eighth Triplet), each with independent enable and swing controls — so the user can shape the macro feel of an entire patch from one place. The intent is that one Meter drives many Beat instances, each per-instrument, each potentially using a different swung/unswung subdivision as its clock.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** — all subdivision outputs, per-output enable + swing (with mockup-aligned blue/orange display), external clock sync, time signature CV, and reset out are working. Display shows BPM, time signature, bars-since-reset, sync indicator, plus per-output hit indicator rows with swing ghost markers and a position tracker.

### Parameters

| Param | Range | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BPM (huge knob) | 30–300 | 120 | Quarter notes per minute (DAW convention) |
| Numerator (snap knob) | 1–16 | 4 | Top of time signature |
| Denominator (config-switch) | indices 0–5 → 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 | 2 (=4) | Bottom of time signature |
| Run (light latch) | momentary | — | Play/stop toggle |
| Reset (button) | momentary | — | Resets bar to 1, position to 0; fires Reset OUT |
| Per-output Enable (×6) | latch w/ green LED | on | Mute that subdivision output |
| Per-output Swing (×5, no swing on BAR) | -0.5 .. +0.5 | 0 | Standard convention: positive = off-beats delayed |

### Inputs
- **BPM CV** (~27 BPM/V)
- **Numerator CV / Denominator CV** (CV stepping)
- **Run gate** (overrides Run button when patched)
- **External clock** (overrides internal BPM; PPQN configurable via context menu: 1/2/4/8/12/16/24)
- Per-output **Enable CV** (×6, gate input that overrides the latch)
- Per-output **Swing CV** (×5, ±5V → ±50%)

### Outputs
All gate outputs are 1ms 10V pulses via `dsp::PulseGenerator`:
- **BAR** (downbeat per bar)
- **QUARTER** / **EIGHTH** / **SIXTEENTH**
- **QUARTER TRIPLET** / **EIGHTH TRIPLET**
- **RESET OUT** (1ms trigger; fires when the Reset button is pressed — Meter is the master, downstream modules receive reset via this jack)

### Display

Top status line:
- Left: current BPM (numeric)
- Sync indicator (right of BPM, only when EXT CLOCK is patched): small dot, dim orange at rest, flashes bright on each external clock pulse, decays over ~100ms
- Center (large): time signature `4/4`, with optional pending `→ 7/8` to the right when a change is queued
- Right: `BAR N` counter, increments on each bar wrap, resets to 1 on Reset

Six per-output hit indicator rows above the position tracker. Each row shows tick marks for that output's pulse positions across the bar, with:
- Swing ghosts (dim ticks at un-swung positions) plus connector lines from ghost → actual position
- A pulse flash that lerps blue → orange when the pulse fires (decays over ~100ms)
- Disabled rows render in dim purple

Position tracker at the bottom: one cell per sixteenth-note in the bar, with the current sixteenth highlighted orange, beat boundaries shown in mid-purple, and other cells dim purple.

### DSP Design

#### Per-subdivision phase accumulators
Each subdivision (Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth, Quarter Triplet, Eighth Triplet) maintains its own `samplesSinceX` accumulator and `pulseCountX` counter. Per sample:
- `samplesPerQuarter = 60 * sampleRate / effectiveBpm`
- `eTarget = swingAdjustedPeriod(pulseCountX, basePeriod, activeSwing[X])`
- When `samplesSinceX >= eTarget`, fire the pulse, subtract eTarget, increment pulse count

#### Bar tracking
SIXTEENTH drives `sixteenthCount`. When it reaches `sixteenthsPerBar = numerator * 16 / denominator`, the bar wraps:
- `sixteenthCount = 0`
- `barsSinceReset++`
- BAR pulse fires
- Triplet phases reset to 0 (so triplets always realign with the downbeat)
- Pending swing values copied to active swing (per-bar latching — see "Swing latching" below)

#### Swing math
```cpp
// pulseCount = pulses already fired since reset.
// Next pulse to fire is pulse (pulseCount + 1).
// Off-beats are pulses 1, 3, 5... (odd index).
bool nextIsOffBeat = (pulseCount % 2) == 0;
return basePeriod * (nextIsOffBeat ? (1 + swing) : (1 - swing));
```
Each pair of (on-beat → off-beat → on-beat) periods sums to exactly 2*base, so on-beats always land on the grid regardless of swing amount. Swing range is ±0.5 (off-beat pulled all the way to the next on-beat at +0.5, all the way to the previous on-beat at -0.5).

#### Swing latching (CRITICAL)
Mid-period swing changes would corrupt the accumulator (the threshold being raced toward changes mid-race), causing notes to fire early or get swallowed. To prevent this:
- `pendingSwing[i]` is read from knob+CV every sample
- `activeSwing[i]` is what `swingAdjustedPeriod` actually uses
- On bar boundary (and on Reset), `activeSwing = pendingSwing`
- On the very first process call, also commit (so initial knob position takes effect immediately)
- Display reflects `pendingSwing` (so the visualization stays responsive while the audio waits for the bar boundary)

#### External clock sync
On each rising edge of EXT CLOCK:
- Measure samples since last pulse → `samplesPerQuarter = samples_between * ppqn`
- `measuredBpmRaw = clamp(60 * sampleRate / samplesPerQuarter, 30, 300)`
- One-pole LPF (coefficient 0.1) toward `measuredBpm`
- Sync indicator flash set to 1.0
- When EXT is connected and has a measurement, `effectiveBpm = measuredBpm`; otherwise `effectiveBpm = bpmKnob + bpmCV`

#### Pulse flash (display only)
Each output has a `pulseFlash[i]` brightness (0..1, decays over 100ms), `pulseFlashIdx[i]` (which tick within the bar most recently fired), and `pulseInBar[i]` (running counter, reset on bar wrap). When BAR fires on the same sample as another subdivision's downbeat, the flash indices for those subdivisions are post-corrected to point at tick 0 of the new bar (rather than the last tick of the old bar).

### Panel Layout (18HP = 91.44mm)

Two-column left side (x=8, x=22):
- BPM huge knob (centered between columns at x=15)
- Y=58: EXT clock | BPM CV
- Y=72: NUM knob | DEN knob
- Y=84: NUM CV | DEN CV
- Y=98: RUN latch | RST button
- Y=110: RUN gate (in) | RESET OUT (with dark plate behind)

Right side: 6 output rows at y=44, 57, 70, 83, 96, 109. Each row has:
- Enable button (latch+LED) at x=44
- Enable CV at x=53
- Swing trimpot at x=65 (omitted on BAR row)
- Swing CV at x=74 (omitted on BAR row)
- Output jack at x=86 (with dark plate behind for visual separation)

### Context Menu
- External Clock PPQN selector (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24)
- "Apply time signature changes immediately" toggle (default off — changes queue for next bar)
- "Reset on play" toggle (default off — Run after Stop resumes from current position)
- "Detected: NN.N BPM" label when ext clock is connected and measuring

### Persistence
JSON saves: running state, ext clock PPQN index, applyTimeSigImmediately, resetOnPlay, outputEnabled[6], barsSinceReset.

## Beat - Per-Voice Pattern Sequencer

### Overview
Beat is a single-voice pattern sequencer designed to be paired with Meter (or any clock+bar source). One Beat instance = one drum/voice. Eight patterns × sixteen steps each, with per-step velocity, accent, and probability. Per-pattern length (1–16) and per-pattern repeat count (1–8 bars) define the macro structure. Most editing happens on the screen — the panel is a narrow 10HP with just the display + jacks.

### Implementation Status
**COMPLETE AND OPERATIONAL** — full edit modes (STEPS / VEL / ACC / PROB), drag-to-paint/scrub across all sequential elements, double-click to toggle pattern active state, on-screen length and repeat count controls, blue/orange Beat-design palette, connector rails between mode tabs/step-grid and pattern-selector/repeats-bar, and persistent state.

### Per-pattern Data (×8 patterns)
- `bool steps[16]` — gate on/off per step
- `float velocities[16]` — 0..1 per step (drives 0..10V VEL output)
- `bool accents[16]` — accent flag per step (drives 1ms ACC pulse)
- `float probabilities[16]` — 0..1 chance the step actually fires when reached
- `int length` — 1..16 (step count per loop)
- `int repeats` — 1..8 (number of bars to play this pattern before advancing)
- `bool active` — included in the pattern rotation

### Inputs
- **CLOCK** — advances the step counter
- **BAR** — advances to the next active pattern (with `repeats` honored)
- **RESET** — returns to first active pattern, step 0
- **MUTE** (gate ≥1V) — silences all three outputs

### Outputs
- **GATE** — 1ms 10V pulse on each fired step
- **VELOCITY** — sample-and-hold CV 0..10V (the previous step's velocity stays held until the next fire)
- **ACCENT** — 1ms 10V pulse on accented steps

### Display Layout (mockup-aligned)

Mockup uses a 174 × 155 unit display (= 46 × 41 mm). Internal coordinates use a `s = w / 174` scale factor for unit conversion. Display origin is at panel `(2.4, 12)` mm.

Top to bottom:
1. **Mode tabs row** (y=8, height 18): 4 cells of 38×18 at x = 7, 47, 87, 127 — `STEPS / VEL / ACC / PROB`. Selected tab = dark blue (`#0D5986`); inactive = dim purple.
2. **Top connector rail** at y=32 (between mode tabs and step grid) — horizontal `#0D5988` line spanning x=7..165, with a short vertical stem from the active mode tab's center.
3. **Step grid** (y=35..73): 2 rows × 8 cols of 18×18 cells. Cells colored:
   - Out of length → very dim (`#1A1A32`)
   - Active step → blue (`#0097DE`)
   - Active step + currently-playing → orange (`#EC652E`)
   - Inactive step at beat boundary (idx % 4 == 0) → mid purple (`#4A4A66`)
   - Inactive step elsewhere → dim purple (`#35354D`)
4. **Length dots** (y=75): 16 small 8×8 dots at x = 7+i*10. Lit (blue) for `i < length`, dim for the rest.
5. **PATTERN label** (y=103, baseline): white text matching mode tab font size, left-aligned.
6. **Pattern selector** (y=111..129): 8 cells of 18×18 with pattern numbers 1–8 slightly above center. Loop-count dots row at the bottom of each cell, centered horizontally — N dots where N = pattern's repeats. The dot at `currentBar - 1` lights bright on the playing pattern; others stay dim.
7. **Bottom connector rail** at y=134.5 (between pattern selector and repeats bar) — same style as the top rail, with a stem from the edit pattern's center.
8. **Repeats bar** (y=137..145): 8 cells of 18×8. Cell colors: orange for current playhead bar, blue for in-range cells (`i < reps`), dim purple for out-of-range.

### Edit Mode Behaviors

**STEPS mode**: Click toggles a step on/off. Drag paints subsequent cells with the same new state (only within current pattern length — drag won't extend length, but click can).

**VEL mode**: Click a cell to set velocity by Y position within the cell (top = 1.0, bottom = 0.0). Vertical drag adjusts further. Auto-enables the step. Cell renders a bottom-up white overlay sized to velocity (60% white in VEL mode, 10% white as a hint in STEPS/ACC modes — skipped entirely in PROB mode).

**ACC mode**: Click toggles the accent flag (auto-enables the step). Drag paints. Accent shows as an unfilled white circle at the cell center — full opacity in ACC mode, 10% opacity hint elsewhere.

**PROB mode**: Same vertical-drag behavior as VEL but writes to `probabilities[]`. Fired probabilistically in DSP via `random::uniform() >= probabilities[step]`. Renders a 60% white bottom-up overlay (only in PROB mode — no faint hints in other modes to avoid clutter).

### Pattern Selector Interactions
- **Left-click**: select for editing (also drag across cells to scrub edit pattern)
- **Double-click**: toggle pattern active/inactive (replaced the previous right-click for better discoverability)
- Inactive patterns are skipped in the rotation

### Length Dots / Repeats Bar Interactions
- **Click** any length dot → set length to that index + 1
- **Drag** across length dots → scrub length 1..16
- **Click** any repeats cell → set repeats to that index + 1
- **Drag** across repeats cells → scrub repeats 1..8
- Scroll-wheel over a pattern cell → adjust that pattern's repeats (alternative shortcut)

### DSP Logic

#### Bar / clock coincidence
Meter typically fires BAR and downbeat-EIGHTH/QUARTER/SIXTEENTH on the same sample. Beat collapses these into a single event: if BAR fired this sample OR if BAR voltage is currently high (still within its 1ms pulse window), CLOCK is suppressed. This handles either-direction sub-sample drift between Meter outputs.

#### Pattern advance
- BAR pulse: `currentBar++`. If `currentBar > repeats`, advance to `nextActivePattern(playPattern)` and `currentBar = 1`. Reset `playStep = 0`. Fire step.
- CLOCK pulse: `playStep = (playStep + 1) % length`. Fire step if active and probability check passes.

#### "Advance only on bar trigger" (default ON)
Context menu toggle. When ON (default), pattern advances only happen on BAR pulse — even if BAR isn't patched, the pattern just loops the same one indefinitely. When OFF (legacy fallback), pattern wrap also advances when BAR isn't connected.

#### Fire logic
```cpp
void fireStepIfActive() {
    if (!steps[playStep]) return;
    if (random::uniform() >= probabilities[playStep]) return;
    gatePulse.trigger(0.001f);
    currentVelocity = clamp(velocities[playStep], 0.f, 1.f);
    if (accents[playStep]) accentPulse.trigger(0.001f);
}
```

### Panel Layout (10HP)
- Display: x=2.4, y=12, 46mm × 41mm
- Inputs row at y=80: CLK (x=8), BAR (x=20), RST (x=32), MUTE (x=44)
- Outputs row at y=110 (with dark plates): GATE (x=10), VEL (x=25.4), ACC (x=40.8)

### Context Menu
- "Advance only on bar trigger" (default ON) — see DSP section above
- Patterns submenu:
  - Randomize current pattern steps (50% density, doesn't touch velocity/accent/probability)
  - Clear current pattern
  - Clear all patterns

### Persistence
JSON saves: editPattern, editMode, playPattern, playStep, currentBar, advanceOnBarOnly, and per-pattern: active, length, repeats, steps[16], velocities[16], accents[16], probabilities[16].

### Default State
On Initialize: all 8 patterns active (so a fresh Beat will visibly cycle through patterns even if most are empty). `advanceOnBarOnly = true`. EditMode = STEPS, EditPattern = 0.
